1,"Asian countries are offering better oilexploration concessions to avert damaging shortfalls due tolast year's oil price slump, the United Nations said. The Bangkok-based U.N. Economic and Social Commission forAsia and the Pacific said in its annual report that the pricefall substantially cut exploration by foreign oil firms, whichfound it unprofitable to maintain investments in the region. Oil production investment in Indonesia fell to about 2.8billion dlrs in 1985 from 3.2 billion in 1983 and was estimatedto have declined six pct last year. There were 11 wells drilledin Thailand in 1986 against 64 in 1985. The report said &lt;Thai Shell Exploration and Production CoLtd>, a unit of the &lt;Royal Dutch/Shell Group> announced a 30pct cut in exploration and production spending last year. To counter declining output, India and Malaysia reducedpetroleum sharing demands, while Indonesia cut taxes. Nepal offered a guaranteed income share of up to 87.5 pctto cover exploration costs, while Thailand began decreasing its12.5 pct royalty payments. The big losers were major regionalexporters such as Indonesia, Brunei, China, Malaysia and Iran.Their aggregate oil income fell an estimated 20 billion dlrs in1986 from 40 billion the previous year. Indonesia's export earnings fell by nearly half in 1986from 11.6 billion dlrs in 1985, the U.N. Report said. Iran also lost about six billion dlrs, Brunei 3.8 billion,China three billion and Malaysia 0.8 billion. However, Asian importers saved between eight and ninebillion dlrs during 1985 and 1986, which considerably easedtheir balance of payments.

5,"U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations inParis last month agreed not to publish any bands in connectionwith their pact to stabilise currencies. Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about whythe participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawsonreplied, ""we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.""When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency floatwith set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said ""I do notwant to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as notto make it easy for"" speculation against the accord. Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individualcountries would take corrective action if their currency beganreacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors. But if such movements were due to extraneous factors,Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aidthrough concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges. ""It is clear that both Germany and Japan are havingdifficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rateappreciations and making their economies more domesticallyoriented, just as it is taking time for the United States tomake its own economy more export oriented,"" Lawson said.

7,"The U.S. Congress is making Japan,with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of theU.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn aroundAmerica's record trade deficit. ""Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: thechallenge to our high technology industries, the threat ofgovernment nutured competition, and the multitude of barriersto our exports,"" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said. ""If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over tradeproblems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,""the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committeehearing on the trade bill. Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, havemade trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-rangingbill is being readied for probable House approval next month. Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrsin 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January. Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. tradedeficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance tothe dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason topress Japan to buy more U.S. goods. They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deteriorationin U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology. In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced heintended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japaneseelectronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide bya 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement. Congress also has been been angered by the administration'slack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issuesincluding beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunicationsgoods, and financial services. The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week infour committees. It is a package of trade sanctions andmeasures to force the administration take tough action againstforeign trade barriers and unfair competition. Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in manycases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japaneseproducts or make them more expensive with higher duties. The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the HouseWays and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is toforce President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreigncompetition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to wintemporary relief from surges in imports. The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrictimports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do notbuy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirantfrom Missouri, has the support of Wright and other keyDemocrats to press for passage of the amendment. The measure would have the most impact on Japan, WestGermany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, doesnot reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States wouldset import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten percent a year for three years. ""I'm tired of going into companies and having managers sayto me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can'tcompete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be takenaway from American business,"" Gephardt said. The administration has said it could not support a tradebill containing such a provision. &#3;"

0,"A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN>to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United CoconutPlanters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sourcesin the Philippine food and brewery company said. A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPBfrom selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC'soutstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings onApril 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a formerchairman of both SMC and UCPB. Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares. Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB andrepresented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB'splans to sell the shares to SMC were ""a serious breach offiduciary duties."" The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also beheld up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, agovernment nominee on the company's board. De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week bythe company's board. On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of thesequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos pershare. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retainedearnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by thepurchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration ofdividends. De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violatean SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debtto equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramondel Rosario as telling the board that the transaction wouldboost the ratio to 2.5-to-1. In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earliersuit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman AndresSoriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties. De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuminglast December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kongsubsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's boardmeeting. An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino toresolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report byApril 15. ""The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part ofa continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregardof the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an earlydisposition of the sequestered shares,"" San Miguel Corp said ina statement. ""Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB havereached agreement on the price of the shares and the method ofpayment, this suit is in direct contravention of thegovernment's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlementof the controversy by April 15,"" the statement added. A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment onCojuangco's court petition, adding: ""Any statement coming fromus might be interpreted as adversarial."" Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel whichsequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligibleto buy the major portion of the shares because he was a UnitedStates citizen. The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln ""A"" shares,which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln ""B"" shares whichare available to foreign buyers. SMC sources said Soriano personally was not amongprospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased bythe &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamedinstitutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyersin a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB. The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission onGood Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they wereowned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former PresidentFerdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in theU.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividendannounced last June.

0,"U.S. District Court Judge EugeneA. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow onBurlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stopSamjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company. Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case couldbe pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeoverbattle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker. Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyersfor Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by DominionTextile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman. Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminaryinjunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer untilthe case is decided. Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlrbuyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per sharelower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjenslast week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjensoffer. Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman andDominion used illegally obtained confidential information aboutthe company in making their takeover attempt.  That information, Burlington said, was provided by JamesAmmeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebberGroup Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington'ssales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never todivulge inside information about the company. Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he beganworking with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to""takeover the company, dismember the company and displace itsmanagement,"" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said. Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information fromPaineWebber, but argued the information was public informationand could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts orBurlington's public financial statements. Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met withEdelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet withthem until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion wentpublic April 24 with their intention to take over the company.Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt atakeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board inFebruary. Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion helddiscussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting asfinancial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke offbecause Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman anddominion with a written statement that they did not provideinside information. Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeenwithdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairmanFrank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive andthreatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in aneffort to takeover Burlilgnton. ""The ultimate question is not the price per share or theprofit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct forthose who would takeover an American company,"" said burlingtonlawyer Humphrey. Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as thelargest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be inviolation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada'slargest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plantsin Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,the lawyers said. Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said themarket for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contendsand that Burlington has the ability to switch between lightweight and heavy weight denim production as demand and pricedictate. Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed byBurlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bidfor Dominion. ""Surely, what would have been sauce for the goosewould have been sauce for the gander,"" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,a Samjens lawyer. "

He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oilprices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixedprice OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demandhave been in equilibrium since March. If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second halfof the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPECproducers have not been able to produce more oil at currentprices, he said. But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting,whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mlnbarrels at its next meeting in June. He said in his speech that world oil production over thelast two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or twomln barrels a day less than world oil demand. Oil production by industrialized countries, particularlythe U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, butsome of that slack will be taken up by increased production inCameroon, India and other developing countries, he said. This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oilproducers and consumers in the industrialized world for theupper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlierspeech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company. ""If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resumeits former role in world oil markets,"" he said.

5,"Japan is becoming dangerously isolatedagain as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated byJapanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth,officials and businessmen from around the world said. As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen,making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investmentsgrit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa saidthere was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise. The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings byboth sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year. The document was prepared by a private committee formed byPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank ofJapan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop frictiondue to its large trade surpluses, Japan must ""make a historicaltransformation in its traditional policies on economicmanagement and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no furtherdevelopment for Japan without this transformation."" Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and havelooked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But theJapanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium termprospects of totally transforming their economic habits. The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japaneseprevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended toraise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports tothe U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateralsemiconductor pact. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened toblock Japanese financial firms from London after the Japaneseplaced what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bidby British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestictelecommunications joint venture. On Friday, European currency dealers said European centralbanks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, mightleave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen. Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business groupKeidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictoryviews last November when he visited the European Community.""Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that Ifound to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europewas the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in theresults of the Maekawa report,"" he said. ""We explained that the process of restructuring the economyaway from its dependence on exports toward a balance betweendomestic and external demand...Would take time,"" Saito said. Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC IndustrialPolicy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said ""Ionly know that your government, under the leadership ofMaekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a lessoutward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawareport which has attracted the most attention in Europe."" And Europeans and Americans want quick action. ""A far betteranswer than protectionism would be structural change within theJapanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. Andwe hope to see changes occur in the near future,"" visitingChairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March. Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly thefault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea ofchange in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials. Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC businessleaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the tradeproblem. ""We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of theMaekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,""said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock. ""The important implication of the Maekawa report is that itis finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of theirlabour,"" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director ofShearson Lehman Brothers. Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance. Japanese officials say they are implementing the report asfast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelledthe country asking about this issue. He said People mentioned many things in line with thespirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal andsteel industries. A major misunderstanding is that the private report wasgovernment policy. Europeans are confused about this,underlined by von Moltke's reference to the ""leadership"" of theMaekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to lastSeptember's government programme of new economic measures.""Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point outthat the government has put its signature to a programmedesigned to implement the report,"" the ambassador said.

2,"Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mlnguilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profitsfor 1987. Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billionguilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said itsrevenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and achange in accounting practice. It added that revenues wouldhave risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred. Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainlydue to its life insurance business. Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rosedespite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums andhigher personal risks. Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damageinsurances. AEGON did not specify the loss. In the United States, revenue in guilders from health andlife insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a changein accounting for U.S. Annuities. AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personalinvestment influences that it should be accounted differentlyfrom the more traditional insurances. This change in accounting practice and another change toaccount for profits made on fixed interest investments,resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mlnguilders. AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profitswere slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initialcosts for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in TheHague. In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emergedin the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initialcosts for these products have depressed net profits somewhat. Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON inMay 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by thesecosts and made only a small contribution to the group'sprofits. AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwillfor Monumental Corp. AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.  "

0,"Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER>subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said itcould realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or notthe deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealermanager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed. But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mlndlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another partyholding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct. The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in anytender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealermanager services or for break-up of the deal. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group ofinvestors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tenderoffer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock. The company's board has approved the plan, which wasintended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp. Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series Apreferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr ashare exercise price before the merger is effective, it said. Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possibleleveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December. At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it wouldconsider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it saidit was told the company had decided against a buyout. But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr ashare proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said. Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warnermanagement was asked not to take part in the new deal and itwas conditioned upon payment of the fees. In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will alsoget up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses inthe tender offer. Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warneras a subsidiary with its current officers keeping theirpositions. But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it isconsidering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number ofsubsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger. All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal. Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debtof Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said. To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects toborrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mlndlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs ofnon-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynchand Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes toMerrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs ofsubordinated discount debentures.

1,"Amoco Corp first quarter profits areexpected to exceed the 165 mln dlrs, or 65 cts per share,reported for 1986's fourth quarter, chairman Richard Morrowsaid. Speaking to reporters after a security analyst meeting, hesaid the gain was expected because of higher oil and gasprices, but declined to compare his expectations with the 331mln dlrs, or 1.28 dlrs per share, the company earned in 1986'sfirst quarter. Earlier, Morrow told the analysts that Amoco's firstquarter refining and marketing results ""will look pretty poor,""because of low margins in January and February. The marginsbegan to improve last month and look pretty good now, he added. Morrow said he expects oil product margins to remain goodfor the rest of the year, ""but it remains to be seen if theywill match 1986 levels."" The Amoco chairman said he expectscrude oil prices to remain in the 17 to 20 dlr barrel range forthe rest of 1988 based on his belief that OPEC's agreement willhold. Morrow said his best estimate for 1989 crude oil prices is21 dlrs per barrel, adding he believes this price level wouldresult in a 40 pct increase in oil company explorationspending. President H. Lawrance Fuller told the analysts Amocoreduced its estimates of worldwide oil and gas reserves by atotal of 201 mln equivalent barrels last year because of a dropin oil and gas prices. Noting the Securities and Exchange Commission requires thatreserves be estimated on the assumption that year-end priceswill remain fixed for the life of the properties, he said thedrop in oil prices to 16 dlrs a barrel at the end of 1986 from27 dlrs a year earlier forced the company to reduce its reserveestimate by four pct. Fuller said Amoco expects its U.S. oil and natural gasliquids production to decline about five pct this year fromlast year's 121 mln barrels because of drilling deferrals madelast year when oil prices were falling. He said the full impact of the deferrals was off-set by thepurchase of properties which will add about 5,000 barrels perday to the company's 1987 U.S. production. Fuller said U.S. refining capacity is expected to beincreasingly strained by the rising demand for lead-freegasoline, especially the higher octane grades. He said expected federal regulations on gasoline vaporpressure will further tighten the industry's gasolineproduction capacity. "

5,"Today's liberalised financial markets aremaking it extremely difficult for Japan's monetary authoritiesto prevent the yen's rise against the dollar, but they haveseveral options other than normal intervention, Bank of Japansources said. A senior central bank official said that such methods ascontrolling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swapagreements with other central banks, which have not beeninvoked since 1978, are all being considered. ""But the time may not be ripe,"" he said. ""In this era of financial liberalisation, it's almostimpossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,""said another senior bank official. But the first official said: ""From a technical viewpoint,the Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediatelyafter other central banks involved agreed to do so."" A swap agreement, an exchange of currency between twonations, allows both sides to acquire a ready source of theother's currency in case of need. ""If the Bank invokes such swaps, both parties would announcethe decision jointly,"" said the first official. The sources said they believed the limit of currency marketintervention may be being reached after they saw recentconcerted market action by central banks of major industrialnations was increasingly ineffective in propping up thebattered dollar. But intervention is at least an option, they said. Furthereasing of monetary policy will be very difficult with anofficial discount rate already at a record low of 2.5 pct, theysaid. Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruledout another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation. One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty ofthe Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with theU.S. And other central banks, if these banks continueintervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and runout of their yen cash positions. ""But we don't think they have become short of yen quite yet,""he said. The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit withthe U.S. Federal Reserve and another 2.5 billion mark and 200billion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks,according to the sources. Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold twobillion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support thedollar in New York last week.

The offer hadbeen scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said hehad received a ""negligible"" number of shares in response to theoffer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate. Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mlncommon shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on aprimary basis. Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization planas an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholderswould receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subjectto approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held inJune. The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mlndlrs in debt to finance the payout. Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that theamended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares togive him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and onthe arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by NewJersey and Nevada gaming authorities. He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring allof Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by amerger transaction.

In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included inthe statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing toincrease the price of his offer.

Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted intoSeries A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby anindependent investment baking firm.

7,"The European Community responded towidespread U.S. criticism of its trade policies by publishingan extensive list of U.S. actions which pose obstacles to ECexports. A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said the detailed25-page report of alleged malpractices was in response to asimilar document issued by U.S. Administration officials inNovember, and updated a previous EC list. EC External Trade Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercqsaid its object was to show such actions were not solely takenby trading partners of the U.S. And that ""the U.S. Were notinnocents in the matter."" The report covers the entire field of EC-U.S. Commercialrelations and lists more than 30 obstacles ranging from tariffmeasures, import quotas, customs duties, anti-dumpingprocedures, fiscal barriers and export subsidies. The Commission said not all the barriers mentioned werenecessarily inconsistent with U.S. International obligations,and emphasised many of them could be removed at upcominginternational trade talks. ""The purpose of the report is to makeclear that trade practices which impede exports are not aunique problem only faced by U.S. Exporters. Europeans facesimilar problems in the U.S.,"" it said. Among the obstacles detailed in the report are importrestrictions on food products, such as cheese, sugar and syrup,certain wines, beers and juices, as well as on firearms andmachine tools. It also criticises programs to boost U.S. Cereals exports.The document said the U.S.'s three-year export enhancementprogram (EEP), which began in 1985, had subsidised exports of9.7 mln tonnes of wheat, two mln tonnes of wheat flour and 2.8mln tonnes of barley up to mid-March this year. The subsidiesgranted so far were worth about 620 mln dlrs, it added. ""The Community has already reacted where necessary to U.S.EEP subsidies by increasing its exports refunds, and willcontinue to do so,"" it said, adding the current GATT round wouldalso provide an opportunity to address the subject. The document also says import quotas maintained by the U.S.On a range of farm products, including sugar, peanuts andcertain cottons, restrict EC exports. In addition, the report deplores a recent U.S.-Japan accordon semi-conductors, export controls on technology transfers,standards tests in the telecommunications arena and the U.S.Administration's ""buy American"" public procurement policy.

4,"Today's U.K. Economic data have pushedthe chances of another base lending rate cut from the currentnine pct further into the distance, analysts said. A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturingproduction data showed that the economy is still strong anddoes not need a fillip from lower rates. News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,taken together with higher than expected bank lending and moneysupply growth, revived inflation worries and monetaristarguments against easier credit, they said. ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed backall the while. The strength of the economy and broad moneygrowth are making it more difficult to see one in the nearterm,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall. Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday'smortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societiessaid were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.Rates. It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week thata post-general election cut was imminent, supported by suchoptimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise whichmirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling'sstrength. The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasmabout May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidlyreplaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlyingaverage earnings in April, dealers said. The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lendingrose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bankof England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offsetthe impact on domestic money supply of its currentintervention. ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin,chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew. ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a verygood state indeed,"" Skeoch said. ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationarypressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost riseswere better than expected, just one pct higher in the year toApril, and it was these costs rather than average earningswhich were potentially inflationary, he added. ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a majorproblem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.

They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japanduring the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lowerits discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feelany need for a cut at all. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reportersearlier today that some countries - those with strongcurrencies - might have to cut interest rates. The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon tocall the G-7 pact a failure. The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar'srenewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked byremarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that thedollar's fall had been orderly. They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker'scomments because he was referring to the dollar's fall sincethe Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,not the currency's recent movements. They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seizeon anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way orthe other. The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting moreweight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging marketstability than on other currencies. Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangersthat would arise from a further dollar fall because it wouldreduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting theU.S. And world economies, they said. In February and in March of this year, Japanese investorsreduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sourcessaid. Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view aboutcurrency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said. This is because the overall foreign exchange market is atriangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen anddollar/European currencies. At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries didnot want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they didnot object to the yen strengthening, they said. "

Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs ofEcuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter netincome by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax. Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mlndlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received onthese loans during the remainder of 1987. Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on thetrading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,although these were partly offset by increased trust income,profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securitiesgains, the bank said. The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986. "

0,"The Securities and ExchangeCommission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptlydisclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart atakeover attempt by Campeau Corp. In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and itslegal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and theagency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shoppingcenter developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau'stakeover offer. Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrson Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo. On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board hadurged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs ashare, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shoppingcenters to DeBartolo, the SEC said. Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who headsthe merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm ofSullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SECfiling to disclose the talks even though they had resulted insales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said. Securities law requires takeover target companies topromptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets. The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pctof Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs ashare from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headedby DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed atthwarting Campeau, the SEC said. Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in anamended SEC filing, the agency charged. Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover wasmade on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaintsaid. DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle forcontrol of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in Octoberwhen it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutesafter it dropped its hostile tender offer. The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federaljudge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake inAllied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share. The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joiningwith Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegaltender offer. But the SEC brief was never filed since the case wasdropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo. In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they complywith reporting provisions of securities laws in the future. Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since itbecame a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual andquarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt. "

0,"Senate Banking Committee ChairmanWilliam Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introducelegislation shortly to require greater public disclosure ofcorporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders. Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increasedthe chance that Congress will act to curb abuses. ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for moredisclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and wouldinsure that takeovers are properly financed,"" he said. Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the thresholdfor notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that ainvestor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in acompany to three pct from the current five pct threshold within10 days, Proxmire said. In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirementthat an investor intended to aquire three pct that would haveto filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant toprevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public inknowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that atender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiringcompany violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmiresaid the legislation would aim at insuring current marginrequirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirementfor purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generallyenforced in hostile takeovers. Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeoverdeclare that they can raise the capital for a takeover withoutactually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages forfailure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct marginrequirements. The bill also would require more disclose when severalinvestors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to knowabout it,"" Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britaintowards two-tiered tender offers that insures that allshareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would coverdefensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills. Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later thismonth and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring. He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill thisyear. "

1,"Exxon Corp said in its annual reportthat it raised production in 1986 although it did not replaceall oil and gas produced. The company said that it added about four pct to productionbringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, basedlargely on increased production of oil overseas but additionsto its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitionsdid not replace all of the oil and gas produced. The company said that the average price for oil and gasdeclined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production. Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985. Exxon said that its principal gains in production came fromthe Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and fromoil sands in Canada. Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres forexpoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europeand the Far East. But capital expenditures for exploration and productionwere cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous yearand further reductions were expected in 1987. Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gasliquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reacheda new high of 422,000 bpd. The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Seafields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able tosell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lowerquality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgradedover the past several years. The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxonmore of a spread in its refinery operations and added toearnings gains from refining and marketing. Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operationsrose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrsin 1985. The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runsrose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year. Exxon's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinerycompleted last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project inRotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudesto extract higher proportions of light products.

1,"Bank profits in the Gulf oil state ofQatar are coming under renewed pressure and foreign banks areretrenching further in one of the region""s most overbankedmarkets. Results for 1986 show a year of declining profit forseveral foreign banks, although locally-owned operations werein some cases able to cushion the drop by increasing marketshare. &lt;Qatar National Bank SAQ>""s (QNB) General Manager, AbdullaKhalid al-Attiya, said: ""The economy is not improving as wehoped... 1987 will be another difficult year for the banks."" Oil-dependent Qatar, with a tiny indigenous population of60,000 to 80,000 and an expatriate workforce estimated at about280,000, boasts five local banks and 10 foreign bankoperations. Local and foreign bankers in the capital said the Gulf-widerecession, aggravated this year by Qatar""s severe difficultymarketing its crude oil at official OPEC prices, has taken aheavy toll on the economy and bank profitability. As a result, the only U.S. Bank, &lt;Citibank NA>, is thoughtto be negotiating to sell its operation to the fast growinglocally based &lt;Al Ahli Bank of Qatar QSC> which only startedoperations in 1984, bankers said. Citibank would not comment. Other foreign banks have retrenched, with &lt;StandardChartered Bank> cutting staff and others expected to follow.&lt;Banque Paribas> is examining a change in its status to admit51 pct Qatari ownership in a bid to improve its access to localbusiness, bankers said. One banker added: ""Weak profits are here to stay for thetime being. There is no cause for optimism at the moment."" Sentiment had picked up briefly at the end of last yearwhen OPEC reached its accord to curb oil output and return tofixed prices. However, it soon became apparent that Qatar washaving difficulty selling oil at OPEC prices. The soft spot oil market has left official Qatari crudeprices 20 to 40 cents more expensive and sales have beenrunning in recent weeks at 100,000 and 120,000 barrels per day,well down on the nation""s OPEC quota of 285,000, oil sourcessaid. Bankers said this serious shortfall in Qatar""s revenue hasled to a new spate of payments delays from the public sector toprivate contractors after a marginal improvement in January. Loan loss provisions continued to eat into bank profitslast year, as did the introduction of minimum reserverequirements by the Qatar Monetary Agency. Trade financing hasalmost dried up as a traditional source of bank income. Of the local banks, QNB conducts the bulk of thegovernment""s business and subsequently enjoys a huge advantageits rivals cannot expect to match, bankers said. The bank reported a 2.9 pct rise in net 1986 profit to 93.1mln Qatari riyals, while its balance sheet grew by 10.8 pct to9.0 billion, making it by far the largest bank in Qatar. But the strong assets growth partly reflected bridgingloans for the public and private sector to tide governmentdepartments and local business over the lean economic spell,Attiya said. ""Generally speaking, we are overbanked in Qatar,"" hesaid, echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community. Other local banks fared less strongly. The second largest,&lt;Doha Bank Ltd QSC>, reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to27.5 mln riyals, while &lt;Commercial Bank of Qatar Ltd QSC>,registered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985. The newcomer Al Ahli Bank, continued to expand rapidly andreported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during thestart-up period from August 4, 1984 to end-1985. Bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to wincommercial deposits previously held by foreign banks,increasing already strong pressure on non-Qatari banks toreexamine their staffing levels and overheads. &lt;Grindlays Bank PLC> recorded a net loss at its Doha branchlast year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profitin 1985 of 12,000 riyals. Two other long-established banks in the Gulf, the &lt;BritishBank of the Middle East> (BBME) and Standard Chartered, alsofound last year a difficult climate to make strong profits. BBME""s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in1985, but Assistant Manager John Farquharson said 1985""s resulthad been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions. ""Foreign banks are seeing their assets decline, while localbanks are increasing their market share,"" Farquharson said. BBME""s operating profit was steady in 1986, edging up to12.3 mln riyals from 11.5 mln in 1985. ""We are expecting thesame level of operating profit in 1987,"" Farquharson said. Standard Chartered""s net profit last year recovered slightlyto 1.6 mln riyals after a loss of 161,000 in 1985. Staffnumbers were cut last year to reduce overheads. Bankers said the lack of new construction projects in Qatarmeans business is unlikely to pick up this year although hopesare rising that the start of Qatari gas exploitation couldprovide a boost. But the threat of higher U.S. Interest ratesmay erode bank deposits as savings are moved offshore. "

7,"French Prime Minister Jacques Chiracopened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus onsuperpower arms control moves and trade issues. French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was topresent France's concern that the United States might ignoreEuropean security interests in any accord with Moscow onremoving medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent. But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will notagree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would givethe Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomatssaid. France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missilesfrom Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge inother weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets,conventional forces and chemical weapons. Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French positionsaying: ""Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces shouldmention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles."" Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending adispute between two leading research institutes over patentrights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS. In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the PasteurInstitute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, ofBethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties fromthe test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fightagainst AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). ""This agreement opens a new era in Franco-Americancooperation, allowing France and the United States to jointheir efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes ofspeeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,"" Reagansaid at the signing ceremony.  He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation. The foundation would also raise private funds and woulddonate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in lessdeveloped countries.  Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and theUnited States during a welcoming ceremony in the White HouseEast Room, with Reagan describing France as ""America's oldestally in war and peace.""  ""I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by thesame ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangerswhich we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, newdiseases and drugs,"" Chirac replied. But the two countries are likely to have less to agree onover the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a risein protectionism in the U.S. Congress.  A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea tosell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way oflessening surplus stocks. Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, firstproposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume,during his two-day visit to Washington. The U.S. official described the idea as a ""grain producers'OPEC"" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries -- and said it went against the Reaganadministration's desire to lessen government intervention intrade.

1,"Growth in oil consumption in the Westernindustrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pctthis year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the InternationalEnergy Agency said. Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by aroundone pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day,the IEA said in its latest monthly report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily fromtransport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if averageconsumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth forthese fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct. The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain narcurrent levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some ofthe market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said. IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECDarea at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. Thisis about the same as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by theprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter ofthe year which offset a reduction in stocks. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonneson April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986. The year-on-year trend of government stock building iscontinuing with company stocks rising, more or less in linewith consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said. Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were putat 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January oneand equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, downfrom the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to94 days of consumption. The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that companystocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the firstquarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd inMarch. And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have alsobeen a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, theIEA said. World oil supply fell through the first quarter by abouttwo bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crudeproduction to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpdin January and to the seasonal drop in exports from CentrallyPlanned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the firstquarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three monthsof 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd asagainst 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largestfactor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. "

The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to thenegotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night withTransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets. No financial details about the Amoco offer were availableand a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amocohad emerged the winner, the newspaper said. However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Domecould be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe andMail said. Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available forcomment. Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Domesaid it was also in talks with two other companies, but refusedto identify them. Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco andExxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary inCanada. British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome. In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured bythe federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,the only Canadian company in the bidding. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to wantto avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the governmentgave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks toencourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts andofficials have said.

1,"Oil prices have stabilized in worldmarkets and demand is likely to increase in the second half ofthe year, Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Subroto said. He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oilprices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixedprice OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demandhave been in equilibrium since March. If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second halfof the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPECproducers have not been able to produce more oil at currentprices, he said. But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting,whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mlnbarrels at its next meeting in June. He said in his speech that world oil production over thelast two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or twomln barrels a day less than world oil demand. Oil production by industrialized countries, particularlythe U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, butsome of that slack will be taken up by increased production inCameroon, India and other developing countries, he said. This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oilproducers and consumers in the industrialized world for theupper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlierspeech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company. ""If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resumeits former role in world oil markets,"" he said. ""But don't expect oil prices to return to the level of 28-30dlrs a barrel, at least not in the next three or four years,""Subroto said. "

However, bankers said one of the main points underdiscussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's mediumterm credit portfolio in the international capital markets. The proposals involve introducing a set of interest marginson ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the sizeand maturity of the credit and the currency. The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankerssaid that while these rates would reduce a bank's return theywould still be more than those proposed about a year ago whenthe government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate anothercost reduction plan. At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow theECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existinggovernment backed credit in the capital markets. On credits that are refinanced an original lender wouldreceive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mlnstg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions. "

1,"Growth in oil consumption in the Westernindustrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pctthis year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the InternationalEnergy Agency (IEA) said. Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by aroundone pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said inits Monthly Oil Market Report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily fromtransport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices arehigher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may bebelow last year's 3.6 pct, it said. The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product pricesstay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users canbe expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain someof the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and theremay be slightly less growth in transport fuels. IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.This is about the same level as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by theprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter ofthe year which offset a reduction in stocks. It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fellby 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of theyear. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd buta decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March. It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reportedstocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonneson April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments builtup strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in theperiod. The year-on-year trend of government stock building iscontinuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, moreor less in line with consumption, after declining for fiveyears, the IEA noted. Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to94 days of consumption. World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mlnbpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crudeproduction to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports fromcentrally-planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the firstquarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpdof crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln averagefor the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was thelargest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEAsaid. Saudi Arabia""s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd. "

5,"Recent slackness on Dutch capitalmarkets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank'spolicy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German markand to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy. While agreeing with the Bank's commitment to defend theguilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more useof the range within which the guilder and the mark canfluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System(EMS). Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV(Amro) said the Central Bank's policy was overcautious. ""I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely therange given to the guilder in the EMS,"" Nelissen said at thepresentation of Amro's 1986 annual report last week. Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate againstthe guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100. The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries tokeep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards astable exchange rate as its main target, using interest ratepolicies to influence the exchange rate. The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rateaims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands. Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short. Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: ""Bymaintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises theexpectation it will always intervene above that level. If itsuddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard toobtain."" Amro's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interestrates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows ofsecurities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capitalmarket. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bringabout small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, headded. Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this isa price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the CentralBank's policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told "

Hutton, noting that it does not represent theneeded premium over the company's fundamental value based onearnings estimates. USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at48-1/8, down 3/8. USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he couldnot comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the boardwould meet to consider it. Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcementthat same day of higher earnings expectations changed itsvalue. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceedanalysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share. At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in thelow 40s, Augenthaler said. Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the wastemanagement concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on theannouncment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs. In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste managementbusiness holds significant growth potential. The industry hasgrown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based onearnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with KidderPeabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said. Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrstotal, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportationand energy company would both gain entry into a profitablebusiness and win cost-control benefits, he said. ""Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairlysignficant environmmental problems of its own,"" he said. Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holdsa 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offerwas ""grossly inadequate."" "
0,"Hollinger Inc will pay about 50 mln dlrscash for its previously reported acquisition of privately ownedUnimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after theannual meeting, confirming a published report. Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag,Black said, ""That would not be wildly inaccurate,"" although hedeclined to disclose the actual cost. Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspapergroup, with three French language daily newspapers in QuebecCity, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants inOntario and Quebec. Black added that Hollinger would also continue seekingacquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23dailies. ""There is really no end to the ones that are available,"" hetold reporters, although he added that most remainingacquisition opportunities are in the U.S. He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,of London, should become profitable in this year's fourthquarter.    For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even orbetter, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs andimproved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largestcirculation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadiandlrs last year. Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight toldreporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's dailycirculation had risen by 25,000 since September to about1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the newIndependent daily newspaper.    Knight said The Independent was not affecting theTelegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulationof other London quality dailies such as The Times and TheGuardian. Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,including extraordinary gains from previous sales ofdiscontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after anextraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.    Black told shareholders that first quarter operatingearnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrsagainst a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs. Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrsfrom 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include DailyTelegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarterfigures were not disclosed.

0,"President Reagan's nominee as toppoliceman for the nation's securities markets will inherit anagency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stockprice gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from theglobalization of financial markets. David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor atNorthwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursdayto be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities andExchange Commission. If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeedJohn Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a recordsix years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands. The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as itsinvestigators have probed into the most colossal insidertrading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street. The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed inrecent months as a growing number of well known traders andprominent investment banking firms have been charged withwrongdoing. The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November afterIvan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stockspeculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigatorsand to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegalprofits after being charged with insider trading. But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing newphenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred bycomputer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. The price gyrations havecombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedentedvolatility to some U.S. securities markets. At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by somelawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporatetakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeoverssteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape. And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreignexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundworkfor an international securities marketplace in which tradingoccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock. Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investmentopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforceU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud. Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financialdisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted tospur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency'sreview of hostile corporate takeovers. Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Huttoninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective tothe agency upon being named chairman in 1981. In line with the views of other top administrationofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeoverbattles over new federal regulations. The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insidertrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases thattopped the agency's enforcement agenda during theadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat. Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted withRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely tosignificantly alter the commission's current priorities. The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of themlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though thatfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as theagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff. The agency is one of the few in the government thatactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the pastfew years because of fees it charges public companies,investment banks and other securities firms it regulates. The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by thepresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firingfor policy differences alone. By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the samepolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget requesteach year instead of leaving this to the White House. Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its originsto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributedin large part to widespread trading on credit and attemptedmarket manipulations by large investment firms. The agency requires public companies and investmentvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports ontheir financial condition and to disclose changes in theircondition any time they issue new securities. It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks toregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, andit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices. Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrialmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later tobecome the nation's 35th president. Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who servedfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon'sfirst term and was Reagan's director of the CentralIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

4,"The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for afurther cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11general election, market analysts said. Sterling would have risen on the much better than expectednumber but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said. But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves nowavailable to the authorities to support the pound should curbany market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show theruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added. ""We have been intervening to a very much greater extent thanwe have done hitherto,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid at a news conference today, commenting on the news of therecord reserves rise. He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvreaccord between leading industrial nations to stabilise thedollar, partly through direct intervention on foreignexchanges. ""We have been playing a very full part ourselves,"" hesaid. But market analysts see the recent upward pressure onsterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp downits rise, more in the light of local factors. Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britainamid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears lastautumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out. U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreignbuyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields asattractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notablyequities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said. Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lowerinterest rates, as the government is expected to try to reversethe loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound. Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reservesnews, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket ofcurrencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released. ""The market doesn't want to do anything because of theelection,"" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank. Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts ofa rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs hadoverestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely tohave been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on theforward market. The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount ofsterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooththe pound's sudden downturn, while some of the interventionreported in May probably occurred in April, they said. The key three months interbank money market rates easedabout 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrendin U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reservesnews, analysts said. Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market wasmuted as traders worried about the funding implications ofanother huge rise in reserves, they added. Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cutfrom the current nine pct level soon after the election, solong as poll projections of another Conservative victory proveaccurate, with another half point later. Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit SuisseBuckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might bepossible. ""Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts infuture, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted. Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautionedagainst over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cutlooked likely. A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out. ""The Bank (of England) is both worried about the politicalproblem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... Andhas signalled some worry about broad money (growth),"" said RobinMarshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities. He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves inthe past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into theEuropean Monetary System. But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they didso. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in. "

1,"British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co hassignalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said. ""I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation andclear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and theythink the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,""said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not alreadyown. ""It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won thewar and oil prices are not going to crack,"" said Prescott, Balland Turben analyst Bruce Lazier. ""Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of theenergy issues out there in the stock market, particularly thosethat are acquisition targets,"" Lazier said. One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, anenergy-steel concern which had been courted by investor CarlIcahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes aCourt last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock. Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firmsfalling into takeover situations for several years, with theexception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most ofthe majors found partners in the last round of matchmakingwhich ended two years ago, and others restructured to the pointthat they have become unattractive. U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. ExxonCorp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. UnocalCorp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4. Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost itsoffer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained itwould not raise the 70 dlr bid. British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8. Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid inthe first place indicates that the British oil giant haschanged its outlook for the oil industry. Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of themore bearish positions on oil prices. ""They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (abarrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hastyretreat from that point of view,"" Margoshes said. ""They are more appropriately today looking moreoptimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs(long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe thatwill be exceeded,"" Margoshes said. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate wastrading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel. Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buyup the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share whenoil prices were falling last year. They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightlymore than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oilfield. Analysts also said the company has other interests inthe Alaskan North Slope. Analysts said the Standard investment is extremelyattractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market andhas hard-to-replace reserves. ""I think it just fits in with their long-range plans toincrease their position in the U.S. market,"" Dean Witteranalyst Eugene Nowak said. Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of theBritish government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BPstock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holdingsometime in the year beginning April one. After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserveswould be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock isheld in the U.S. ""The only way they can sell all that stock is to move itinto the United States. No other market can handle all thatstock,"" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua. In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs onrevenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the yearearlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.  "

3,"The 350 mln Ecu three-year package ofsocial and structural measures agreed early today by EuropeanCommunity farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmersfor reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commissionsources said. The ministers agreed that under this ""extensification""scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cutoutput of specific products by at least 20 pct. The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal andwine, they added. Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts byreducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce theirnumber of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case,farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacityfor output of other products which are in surplus in the EC. The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed butwill be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit onthe production they forego. The sources said the package also contains provisions forpayments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protectingor improving the environment. It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favouredfarming areas would be extended to crops. At present suchallowances are available only for livestock. The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research intoalternative farming techniques, the sources added. At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessensaid the Commission is also working on proposals to enable theEC and member states to provide direct income supports forrelatively poor farmers. Andriessen did not give full details, but said member stateaid would be subject to ""strict criteria to avoid distortion ofcompetition."" EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive adifficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplusproduction. The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last nightproposals to pay ""early retirement"" pensions to farmers aged 55or over who gave up production. Those who took their landcompletely out of farm production, rather than passing it on totheir heirs, would have received more generous payments. Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revisedproposals along these lines in an effort to get a schemeagreed. "

Michel Girardin, DRI Europe's senior economist, said at aconference that Italian GDP growth this year ""will be mainlydriven by consumption and especially investment."" Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next yearwill shift from domestic demand to exports as a result ofexpected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies. Italy's budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7pct in real terms in 1986. DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pctin 1986, will be under five pct this year and that interestrates should drop two pct. Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pctagainst the dollar this year following last year's 22 pctappreciation. An expected German mark appreciation against thedollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of itsvalue relative to the German currency, he said.

0,"A 3.22 billion dlr offer for DomePetroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the doorfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations. TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added. ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward,"" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada's proposed offer. "

Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd fromaround 370,000 in February after the emirate declared amid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, thesources added. Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaifand Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixedprices too high and cut liftings, the sources said.

The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclosethat one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which itterms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable torepay it. Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share tostockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced anextensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimedat thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing. British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of therecapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing itsalternatives. British Printing said it filed the suit after consultationwith its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourtfailed to disclose the effect of the special dividend onHarcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures. British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormousincrease effective on the June eight record date for thedividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable uponconversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convertdenbentures before the record date because Harcourt may nothave enough authorized common shares to honor conversion afterthe date. British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrsworth of debentures. The suit also alleges that management, the board ofdirectors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme ofentrenchment through a combination of selling to First BostonSecurities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertiblevoting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchaseprogram and the manner in which its financing has beenstructured.

1,"Top executives with Tenneco Corp &lt;TGT>and Sabine Corp &lt;SAB> said they expected world oil prices togradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance onimports of oil from the Middle East grows.  ""I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to atrend of gradually increasing prices,"" C.W. Nance, president ofTenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of thePetroleum Equipment Suppliers Association.  Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization ofProducing and Exporting Countries would be producing at therate of 80 pct of capacity. The gain will come largely through increased imports to theUnited States, he said. ""They will be able to raise the price again but I do notthink they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,"" Nancesaid. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.  Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predictedthat world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climbfrom a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.  ""Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct inincreased demand,"" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry'soutlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal lawprohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plantsand utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15pct, he said.  Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities mayexperience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies nextwinter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.  Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20pct during 1986, he said.  ""This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,"" Nance said.""We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question ishow broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or threeyears before we start to climb out?""   J.C. Walter of &lt;Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recentimprovement in oil prices was not enough for independentproducers to begin new onshore drilling projects.  ""If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlrper mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshoreexploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast byindependents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,"" Walter said.

7,"Japan is attempting to cut backsemiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S.tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April17, industry analysts said. The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and apossible shortage of the key computer components in the nextfew weeks, the analysts said. ""Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay ofthe Japanese semiconductor industry,"" analyst Drew Peck ofDonaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said. But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far,and some questioned whether Japan would be successful inforcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run. Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence wasalready in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and haltedsales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sellchips at below production costs. ""We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, andit has virtually dried up for EPROMS,"" said Merrill Lynchanalyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used incomputers. ""Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries arestretching,"" Kurlack added. Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of InternationalTrade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs inproduction to meet the terms of last year's semiconductoraccord with the U.S. The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs onJapanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed tolive up to the accord and continued to dump the computercomponents in the U.S. market. But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S.was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form oftrade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S. As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, priceswill rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductormanufactures will be able to take up the slack since most longago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makersthat use the chips in their machines will then be pressured. ""The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce tradepressures from Washington, but at the same time they'redemonstating their muscle,"" analyst Peck said. The cut backs in Japanese production are expected tobenefit U.S. chip makers. ""I think this could be a very important factor for U.S.semiconductor manufacturers,"" industry analyst Elliot Levine ofLadenburg Thalmann Co said. But analyst Peck said, ""it will take a few weeks to seewhether Japan has genuinely cut production."" He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI'srequest unfavorably because chip capacity was still high andproduction cut backs would lead to significant write-offs inplant and equipment. "

The planned spending for exploration and production in 1987remains well below the 1.1 billion dlrs spent in 1985, Unocalsaid. The company's proved developed and undeveloped reserves ofcrude oil rose slightly in 1986, Unocal said. Net crude oil andcondensate reserves were 752 mln bbls as of Dec 31, 1986,compared to 751 mln bbls at the end of 1985, Unocal said. The company said its net crude oil and condensateproduction averaged 248,200 barrels per day in 1986 compared to251,300 bpd in 1985. Unocal said its worldwide natural gas reserves were 6.07billion cubic feet in 1986 compared to 1985's 6.19 billion. Netnatural gas output averaged 976 mln cubic feet per day in 1986,down 10 pct from 1985's 1,084 mln, the company said.

7,"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone soundeda conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with theUnited States over trade in computer microchips. ""Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations byexplaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points thatneed to be corrected,"" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service assaying. While expressing regret over America's decision to imposetariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone saidTokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washingtonto help settle the dispute. Government officials said Japan would make a formal requestnext week for emergency talks and that the two sides wouldprobably meet the week after, just days before the April 17deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japaninvestigation of American claims that Japanese companies aredumping cut-price chips in Asian markets. Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronicgoods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure tolive up to their bilateral chip pact. That agreement, hammered out late last year after months ofheated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-pricechips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips. Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatorythan those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,who earlier today said Japan was ready to take ""appropriatemeasures"" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions. Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura'sremark and said that his main message was that the two sidesneed to talk urgently about the issue. But they admitted that Japan was considering taking theUnited States to GATT, the Geneva-based internationalorganization which polices world trade, if Washington imposedthe tariffs. Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), theysaid. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panelto consider the legality of the U.S. Action. But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. ""Itmay be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the UnitedStates may lift its decision at an early date,"" Tamura said. In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, PresidentRonald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he hadevidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in worldmarkets and had opened up its own market to imports. Japanese government officials said they are confident theycan make the pact work. They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chipsthrough unregulated distributors has all but dried up afterMITI instructed domestic makers to cut output. While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japaneseimports of American chips, MITI officials said that theministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens. The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users,some of whom are also leading producers, to step up theirpurchases of foreign semiconductors. A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>said his firm would do just that and could announce its plansin the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies todo likewise.

0,"Spectra-Physics Inc said it isconsidering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring,or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection ofan unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company alsosaid its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 topexecutives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their basesalary if they stay with the company through August 29. In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiaryof Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair. The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with twoCiba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject theSwiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanleyand Co Inc, that it is ""inadequate and unfair from a financialpoint of view to the holders of shares,"" the company said. The board also authorized a special committee and MorganStanley to ""vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize anyalternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'investment in the company,"" the company said. Among the alternatives the special committee will considerare a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, includingself tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use ofdividends, Spectra-Physics said. The ""retention plan"" for the 52 top officers will pay anaverage bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said. Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan ""in orderto encourage key operating personnel to remain with the companyduring the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the(Ciba-Geigy) offer."" Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to theircash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasonsother than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave thecompany because their salaries have been sharply cut. Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigyyesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., chargingit with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading inviolation of securities law and with violating the intent ofJuly 9, 1985 standstill agreement. Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time ofthe standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicitedtakeover proposal for the company and that the intent of theagreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat. Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and RelianceGroup Holdings &lt;REL>, which is controlled by New York investorSaul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct. Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy fromraising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1, 1992, unlessanother person get more than 10 pct of its voting power. "

2,"Chemical New York Corp said itsfirst-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.

A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrsfrom 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise wasmainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth inconsumer, capital markets and investment banking activities. Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or4.3 pct below 1986 earnings. Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs ofmedium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are notresumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for thewhole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.

Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrsfrom 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from3.96 pct. This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, areduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculationof the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) anda narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical'scost of funds.

First quarter revenues were down 13 pct to 19.44 billiondlrs.    One time items aside, Exxon said, its first quarter resultswere stronger than 1986's final quarter which included severallarge asset sales and positive inventory adjustments. It said earnings per share declined 36 pct reflecting thecompany's continued purchases of its own common for thetreasury. During the first quarter, 5,085,000 shares wereacquired at a cost of 416 mln dlrs compared with 3,132,000 in1986's fourth quarter. Commenting on the first quarter, Exxon said crude oilprices strengthened moderately within the quarter and werehigher than a year ago at the end of the quarter.    However, average crude prices for the quarter were belowthe year ago period, leading to lower earnings for explorationand production operations, Exxon said. Also contributing to reduced earnings were lower naturalgas prices, primarily overseas, representing contractadjustments representing contract adjustments tied to fallingproduct prices in 1986, the company said. During the first quarter, the company said, intensecompetition in both domestic and international markets servedto depress margins for refined products.    Exxon said the lower product margins resulted insignificantly reduced earnings for refining and marketingoperations, contrasting sharply with the unusually strongmargins prevailing in the first qtr of 1986. It said savings from efforts to control costs and improveefficiency helped soften the negative impact of lower oil andnatural gas prices. Exxon said earnings from chemicals and power generationactivities showed consideratble improvement, remaining strongthroughout the period. "

""Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but willnot remain there long if products are not strong,"" RobertMurphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said. Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that theAmerican Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domesticinventories of petroleum products in a weekly report. Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation inthe Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a newoffensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshoreoil fields and an oil export depot.

Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before theclose with support from the silver market, which wasapproaching two-year highs, traders said.

Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, andthe soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, whichis limiting supplies. In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projecteda substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.

Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strengthrelated to tight supplies. Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gainspast three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meatpackers to bid aggressively for available animals.

In a speech at the World Petroleum Congress here, Rawl saidoil companies would increasingly be forced to turn to enhancedrecovery techniques, very heavy oil and synthetics tocompensate for substantial declines in conventional oilproduction. ""What our current outlook suggests is that total worldenergy consumption will continue to grow steadily in an evermore energy efficient world,"" Rawl said. But, he added, Exxonprojects that ""despite today's ample supplies, the world willalso be facing up to inherent limitations on the availabilityof oil and gas, which currently supplies more than half of theworld's energy needs."" The Exxon chairman told some 1,500 oil executives fromaround the world that some synthetics projects could becomepractical when oil reaches 30 dlrs to 40 dlrs a barrel range inreal terms. ""The question is when and how this will happen,"" he said.""I believe that synthetic projects will not only re-emerge butwill become commercial well below those we were thinking aboutthe last time oil prices moved substantially higher."" Rawl said synthetic fuel would become economic at lowerprices because companies are investigating ""a new generation ofideas that promise substantially lower costs"" and projectsbegun in the late 1970s, which have since been suspended. Rawl also said companies must find new and more effectiveways of enhanced recovery from existing oil fields. ""It would be my view that new oil discoveries, even withadvanced technology, are likely to slow down - not reverse -the decline in worldwide oil discoveries,"" he said. ""So it isessential to find a better way to recover more of thediscovered oil from producing fields using chemicals, solvents,heat, and other techniques."" Rawl emphasized that private oil companies need someassistance from government in developing synfuels technology.""More importantly, they need to provide a political andeconomic environment that is stable enough to allow thedevelopmental process to function effectively, he said. Rawl also said stable energy markets serve the bestinterest of producing and consuming nations by allowing bothgroups to plan for steady economic growth. He did not make any oil price prediction, saying only thatthe economic goals of the U.S. and other nations can only beachieved if world oil prices ""stabilize within a reasonablerange."" ""Prices must be high enough to meet realistic aspirationsfor income and encourage resource development in the producingcountries, but not so high as to inhibit economic growth inconsuming nations,"" he said.

3,"Torrential rains throughoutArgentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarsegrain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularlyaffected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid tosoybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April orMay. The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghumcrops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yieldsand cut the total volume of this year's harvest. Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis. No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa. Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume ofthe coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates. Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central SantaFe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct oftotal planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week. Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest wasestimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two toseven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the1985/86 harvest. Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according toofficial figures. The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and ninepct of total planted area. Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowersfor this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figureof 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mlnand 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the1985/86 harvest. Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two andfour pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mlnhectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2million tonnes harvested in 1985/86. Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit arecord 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figuresput last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes. Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very goodcondition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures. Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest isexpected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares. "

5,"The price of gold bullion and shareprices of North American gold stocks are benefiting fromcontinued weakness in the U.S. dollar, analysts said. ""There's been a tug of war between the (currency)speculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and itlooks like the game has gone to the speculators,"" said John Ingat Maison Placements Canada Inc. The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows todayagainst the Japanese yen despite buying by several centralbanks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said. A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is thetraditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted. Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd,noted that ""a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars.If they see they are losing money, they move back into gold."" A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ingsaid, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to afour pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct. Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from itscurrent level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees anaverage price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, MichaelPickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs,with a possible spike above 500 dlrs. However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen farfaster in recent months than the price of the metal itself,causing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewherein the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no signthe buying pressure is slowing down. ""The stocks have run anincredible way,"" Cohen said. On U.S. markets today, ASA Ltd &lt;ASA> rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2,Campbell Red Lake Mines &lt;CRK> was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold&lt;NGC> increased 1-1/2 to 31-1/4. The Toronto Stock Exchange gold index today was up 268points at 8067.90. Hemlo Gold gained 1-1/4 at 26-3/4, LACMinerals was up 1-5/8 at 41, Placer Development rose 1-1/4 at43-3/8 and Lacana Mining gained 1 at 18. Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pctsince December 31, 1986, while the price of bullion hasincreased six pct. ""Canadian golds have been the top performingindex this year,"" he noted. In the U.S., there is ""too much money chasing too fewstocks,"" Pickens said. And many investing institutions such aspension funds and insurance companies still have excess cash,he added. Cohen also noted that today's silver price break throughsix dlrs an ounce indicates small investors are entering theprecious metals market and he expects the ratio between goldand silver prices to narrow.

0,"The largest U.S. textile maker focusedon its own business as its competitors found merger partners,but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itselfinto an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said. The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman andDominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pctstake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointlyacquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeoveroffer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman forMontreal-based Dominion called the report just ""rumors."" Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced ofthe story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors ifBurlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that itwas looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Millsand has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used fora U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producerhas been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies, butwould not say whether Burlington was among them. ""There have been acquisitions in this area. It's notunusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after thehousecleaning they've done,"" said Eileen Gormley of ThomsonMcKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheetsand other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrslast year. It also has reorganized management, and focused itsoperations on businesses that would be less affected by foreigncompetition, Gormley said. ""They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,""said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrialfabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpetsand other fabric to the auto industry. ""In the past, they just spent and never realized the returnon the outlays they did make,"" she said. ""You look at their record over the year, and I thinkthey're poised to be more profitable than they had been in thepast,"" Gormley said.  She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, upfrom 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlingtonat its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommendsselling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earningsbasis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have beenplaced on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. ""After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of peopledon't find him very credible anymore,"" said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcingmanagements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even ifhe doesn't win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for LuckyStores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buyingPonderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along withBurlington. J.P.

0,"UAL Inc may have a response thisafternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its UnitedAirlines unit, a UAL spokesman said. ""Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and weneed to get a clarification out,"" the spokesman said, addingthat there was a ""50-50"" chance a statement would be releasedtoday. The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt. Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for severalweeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developerDonald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he alsoheld discussions with its chairman. The developer indicated in those talks that he took theposition as an investment, but he revealed no other plans. Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buyingUAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2mln shares. ""United has got to consider this proposal. I think thepilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,but it could put some interesting options in front of UALmanagement,"" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst. Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attackwhen it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertzrental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in astrategy to become a travel service company. The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots unionconcerned that the company was not focussing enough attentionon its airline. UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing itsnew focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one. But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street hasbeen busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL aswidespread, indicative to them that big institutions believethe stock is in play. Market sources have said that although Trump attractedattention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as acatalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhapsthrowing the company into the hands of another buyer. ""The first domino is you have an investor with aconsiderable stake. the second domino is the union. That typeof attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,""said Pettee. ""What's interesting is the values are there. There'ssomething for everybody,"" he said. "

The U.S. Will also try to develop proposals made at the1986 Tokyo Summit for measures to ensure agreements such as theParis Accord are more binding, they said. Treasury Secretary James Baker's dual initiatives reflectU.S. Frustration with the two countries for not moving fastenough to curb their huge trade surpluses, they added. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is expected tobring the outline of an economic stimulus package to themeeting, which will be attended by West Germany, France,Britain, Italy and Canada as well as the U.S. And Japan, thesources said. ""The sooner the Japanese can announce their intention toannounce a stimulative package,the better it is for Japan andfor the exchange markets in general,"" one of the sources said. Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Paris Agreement, inwhich West Germany and Japan made their commitments, will berenewed by the industrial countries this week. Other U.S. Officials said a meeting of the Group of Sevenwill be a status report on progress Bonn and Tokyo have madesetting up stimulus measures. The U.S. Will tell its partners that it expects a furthersubstantial budget deficit reduction package to be agreed withCongress this year, the sources said. Washington would like its economic partners to establishspecific economic policy goals. Sharp deviations from the setobjectives would trigger consultations among the countries onappropriate corrective action, they added. The Paris accord envisaged surplus countries like Japan andWest Germany stimulating domestic demand to absorb more importsand the U.S. Cutting its budget deficit, thereby depressing itsdemand for imports. But the markets are signalling the dollar's floor may befar below its level at the time the Paris agreement was struck,the sources said.

0,"Corporate mergers and acquisitionsin and around San Francisco over the past seven years have hadonly a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, aleading business-backed organization said. The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 businessfirms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in anine-county area found that San Francisco itself had sufferedsome ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surroundingcommunities had not. Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area leftdue to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, butanother 21 firms were added to the list. Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.During the period, only six located in the city achievedFortune 500 status. Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director ofMcKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the studygrew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriouslyhurt the economic climate of northern California. However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had beenlost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs werecreated during the period. At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greaterrise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the restof the United States and California. Council President George Keller, who also is chairman andchief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a newsconference that the region had difficulties in persuadingcompanies to locate there because of a fragmented localpolitical system. But he said that because of the amenities of living in SanFrancisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in othermetropolitan area. ""It's a great place to run a business,"" he added, ""but it'sa hell of a place to do business with government."" The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with GulfOil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from therestructuring activity. Among the corporate headquarters lost during the periodwere Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;Cooke and Rolm. Companies that grew enough during the period to make theFortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac. The study by the management consulting firm said that,partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growthin San Francisco has slowed since 1980. In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadershiphad adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic andcharitable activities. "

7,"Amid new concerns about inflation,interest rate increases and trade confrontations,finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discussa deteriorating global debt and economic situation. The meetings, under the auspices of the InternationalMonetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates areturning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further,upsetting bond and stock markets. Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the globaleconomy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continueto carry the burden of their growing debt without vast newassistance. Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signsany new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury SecretaryJames Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works. The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil,which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs ofcommercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded bylaying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans. Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in avisit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out theadministration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses tothe very poorest states. The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministersin detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly beembraced by the developing countries. ""There's interest on the part of some countries for lookingat the support of the special problems of the very poorestcountries, because their position is so extreme,"" a Reaganadministration official said. He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue. The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debtinitiative, which called for new funding to help debtorcountries grow out of their problems. The largest industrial countries have been attempting tocoordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling thedecline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and otherproblems. At the same time, the industrial countries see littleevidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fundforecasts they will grow 2.5 pct. The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked otherindustrial countries to stimulate their economies. These issues directly affect the debt problem and theability of the debtor countries to grow out of theirdifficulties. In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports ofdeveloping country, allowing them to earn critical foreignexchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit,running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing othersto import more from developing countries. The discussions, from April six to 10, will bewide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to theimpact of development loans on the environment, according tomonetary sources. The talks will include an examination of tradeprotectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reaganadministration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs onmicrochip products from Japan, the sources said. The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financialmarkets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing. There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. chargesthat Japan has been selling computer chip products below fairmarket value and has kept its own market closed to imports,further undermining the international trading system. At the same time, the ministers will discuss thefundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the exportmainstay of many developing countries. The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- theUnited States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- willgather for the first time since their February talks in Paris,where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further. The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada forfurther debate on economic policy coordination. As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such asJapan agreed to stimulate their economies, while Americasaid it would reduce its federal budget deficit. Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to tohave a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank, strengthening the link between loans andeconomic policy changes in debtor nations. Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take moreaccount of the environment when making loan for dams and otherprojects. The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said thisissue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganizationplan for the Bank, now being prepared. "

0,"Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd postedtheir biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stockmarkets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for thedebt-heavy company. Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange andgained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto StockExchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as highas 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Domehas normally moved by only a few cents per day. TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlrCanadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, butDome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also stilltalking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify. Market analysts today said the other two firms are believedto be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterdaystressed that its bid is ""a Canadian solution to the financialdifficulties of Dome Petroleum."" ""The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont&lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadianinterest in 1975 and could be getting back in,"" said Wilf Gobertof Peters and Co Ltd. David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that BritishPetroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despiteBP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percentof Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own. Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has saidin recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talkswith Dome. Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as ""awfullyoptimistic,"" given TransCanada's offer to give current Domeshareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10dlrs Canadian per common share. Under the offer, current Dome common and preferredshareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, whichwould own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanadawould own 80 pct. However, Bryson said the market may be looking at thepotential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. ""TheTransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,""he said. Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is ""at theupper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome."" The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with anotherone billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available tosecured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above acertain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level. Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billionCanadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took onseveral years ago when oil prices were high and the companywanted to expand. ""There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capableof supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on thatbasis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,""Gobert said. Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that itis a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holdsreserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billioncubic feet of natural gas. The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acresof oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, theheart of Canada's oil industry.   Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres ofland across Canada.   The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrsCanadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.).

""I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in thedollar,"" Viermetz said. ""I believe there is room for a furtherfall of five to 10 per cent in 1987."" The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, GreatBritain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late Februaryto stabilise major currencies around current levels. The accord came after months of transatlantic argument,with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington's policy of talking thedollar lower had made life impossible for West German andJapanese exporters. The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continuedslide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York inSeptember 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress thevalue of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances. But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty's economic models showedthat with no further change in exchange rates -- and continuedsluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Tradedeficit would improve only temporarily. He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs thisyear from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120billion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160billion dlrs. ""This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authoritiesand politicians in Washington,"" he said. Viermetz said it was only natural that markets shouldattempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struckwhen the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen. Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or""Plaza Accord,"" the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240yen. Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted tosee the dollar hold within a ""loose range"" of 1.75 to 1.90 marksand 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currencylower being countered by central bank intervention. The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen --its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40years. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks. Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal fundsrate falling below six pct for fear of provoking anuncontrolled fall in the dollar. But at the same time, worries about the international debtcrisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world. The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings togethermore than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arabworld and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres. Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred onthe role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankersurging them to adapt to a new global trend towardssecuritisation of  business. Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab BankersAssociation, said Arab banks have to shake off their oldmentality of commercial banking and concentrate more oninvestment banking. "

5,"The government is determined to ride outthe latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measuresbecause it expects the currency's appreciation to provetemporary, senior officials said. ""The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) andmarket forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit,"" one seniorFinance Ministry official said. He attributed the dollar's fall in recent days to specialfactors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead ofthe March 31 end to their fiscal year. That selling largely came to an end this morning afterabout one hour of trading here, the senior official said. ""They(the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock(0100 GMT),"" he said. After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning,the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20.Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilisethe dollar above 150 yen. Several officials said they did not see any fundamentalreason for the dollar's recent sharp fall. One official even called the market's recent actionsirrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs onJapanese electronics goods should support the dollar againstthe yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., Hesaid. As a result, several officials said they saw no reason toalter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at lastmonth's meeting of major nations in Paris. ""We don't see any substantial reason to change our policystance,"" one senior official said.&#3;"

2,"Losses for Volkswagen AG&lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud willnot exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VWspokesman said. The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed itwould pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on1986 business, despite the provision. One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currencydealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses fromthe currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, butthe VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an ""upper limit."" VW said in a statement following today's supervisory boardmeeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal indetail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreigncurrency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditingcompany. VW has said computer programs were erased and documentswere faked in the alleged fraud in which it believestransactions intended to protect it against possible foreigncurrency losses were not completed. VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger wasarrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of havingevaded justice. Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks andparent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommendan unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company hasalso set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,which were issued last year. Analysts have described the helddividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders. VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5billion marks, with the result that its total dividend paymenton 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,since the new capital was in preference shares. The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves inorder to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. Atthe end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightlyless than three billion marks. "

0,"GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-WarnerCorp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts tobe preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.  Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill LynchCapital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash andsecurities for the balance. Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8. ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming inwith another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at51 or 52 dlrs per share. GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct ofBorg-Warner's stock. ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to upthe price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you haveto. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're lookingat it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst RichardHenderson said. Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share. GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. MerrillLynch officials did not return phone calls. Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heymansought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plasticsbusiness. The rigid plastics are used in such things astelephones, computer terminals, and appliances. ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemicaloperation these days,"" said Henderson. ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and hedoes not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson. GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeoverof the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAFdid not win the company, it made a substantial gain on itsinvestment in Carbide. Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into itsBorg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offerand does not succeed, a higher bid from another company wouldgive GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock. ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst. One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would beforthcoming shortly. ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in thisbook,"" he said. Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,protective services, which includes Wells Fargo securityguards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who followsGAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, itwould realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 pershare. ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" saidRose. Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heymanwould do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."" ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemicalenterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rosesaid. Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would addearnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, ifthey sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said JohnHenry of E.F. Hutton. Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billiondlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and netearnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.

0,"Computer Associates International Inc's800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp &lt;UCE> will eliminate itsstrongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competitionfrom International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, Wall Streetanalysts said.  ""IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systemssoftware,"" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkinand Jenrette. ""But the combination of the two companies will clearlypresent a much stronger front,"" he said. Besides IBM, ""Computer Associates will be far and away themost powerful company in the field,"" added E.F. Hutton analystTerence Quinn. That field is a segment of the market known as systemutilities, or software packages that boost the productivity ofa company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,power and efficiency of large mainframe computers. The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines thetwo biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms thatwill find the competition much harder than in the past. For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps asix-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry. When the deal is completed sometime in August, thecompany's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independentsoftware vendor. Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wangtook the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3mln dlrs for the year ended March 31. Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computerbusinesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframecomputer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp. Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after themerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth. On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of sixcompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs. For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, onsales of 141.5 mln dlrs. The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largelybecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from thedark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or56 cts a share.   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 differentbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computersoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and amajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from hisjob as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer servicesunit. Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at anews conference that the merger would give computer users asingle source for a wide range of software products. In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates alsosell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroadsin the applications software market, where analysts said it hasbeen successful with accounting and banking systems. Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support andenhance both companies' product lines, but noted that thecompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He saidabout 20 pct of the companies' products overlap. Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings ofcurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. Butthey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not diluteComputer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year. Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record ofcompleting acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05dlrs a share. Wang said he would look closely at the combined operationsof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketingand research and development. Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share. Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said mostsoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 timesper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth thepremium because of its earnings potential and customer base. Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currentlyowns 58 pct of Uccel. The executive said the merger would not alter his target ofmaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct. In addition, he said he expects no problems in having thedeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. JusticeDepartment. Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after themerger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang. "

South Korea has agreed to pay Japanese trading houses justover 400 dlrs C and F per tonne, up from an average of 350 dlrsin the first quarter and throughout 1986, they said. South Korean demand for imported ethylene this month hasrisen to 17,000 tonnes from 10,000 last month, and the countrymay face difficulties covering the extra volume, they said. &lt;Korea Petrochemical Industries Corp>, a producer of highdensity polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene, will more thandouble its ethylene requirements to 9,000 tonnes a month from4,000 when it completes a plant expansion at the end of thismonth, the sources said. &lt;Honan Ethylene Corp's> import requirements have risen to8,000 tonnes a month from 6,000 tonnes last year to meet strongdemand from &lt;Honan Petrochemical Co>, which makes HDPE andethylene glycol, and &lt;Hangyang Chemical>, which produceslow-density polyethylene and vinyl chloride monomer, they said. But Japan's ethylene plants are already operating at almostfull capacity of 4.5 mln tonnes a year just to fulfill domesticdemand, the sources said. ""And even if Japan had the additional ethylene, there is alogistical problem of finding extra appropriate-sized vesselsto ship it to Korea,"" said one trading house source. Japanese trading companies are looking to alternativesources to supply South Korea's needs, including Saudi Arabia,Qatar and Mexico, they said. But long-haul voyages are expensive as the product has tobe shipped at a temperature of minus 103 degrees centigrade tokeep it in a liquid form, they said. Japan has no plans to invest further in the ethyleneindustry in order to cope with the additional demand, despiterising prices, trading house sources said. South Korea has two projects in hand which will increaseits ethylene production capacity by 500,000 tonnes a year bythe end of 1989, so the strong demand surge for imports is onlya medium-term trend, they said.

1,"Canada's federal governmentwill provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package thatincludes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of acompany's oil and gas exploration and development costs, EnergyMinister Marcel Masse announced. The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year intothe oil and gas industry and could lead to more than onebillion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference. The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada onor after April 1, 1987. Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aidpackage is aimed at small and medium sized companies. The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration andDevelopment Incentive Program, will restrict the total paymentsthat any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year. Masse said the program will probably generate newemployment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year. He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration anddevelopment spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oilprices fell during the first half of 1986. Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decidedto provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax payingcompanies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the fullvalue of the incentive. Such companies would not immediatelybenefit from tax benefits, he said. The federal government also wanted to deliver an aidprogram outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilsonis now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce taxreform proposals later this spring. An important feature of the aid program is a decision tolet companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors tobenefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits toonly participating companies, he said. Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make iteasier for companies to attract investors in exploration anddevelopment, Masse said. He told reporters his department is still consideringwhether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify forthe subsidy. "

The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to generalelections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber,palm oil, tin, timber and coffee. Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of theappreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark againstthe dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments. He said the economy would have suffered more from the worldeconomic recession if the government had not devalued therupiah by 31 pct last September.

4,"Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interestrates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability. Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Sevencountries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he saidcentral banks would continue to intervene ""as and whennecessary."" He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do moreto stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined byJapanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday. Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of asimultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and WestGermany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budgetspeech to the British Parliament. ""If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there isstill a risk,"" he said. Asked if the United States should consider increasinginterest rates to support the dollar, he said, ""If there is aneed for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need tobe a rise in interest rates in the United States."" Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday'smeetings at the slow progress the United States had made inreducing its budget deficit. ""We believe there will be some worthwhile progress inreducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that itcontinue year after year,"" Lawson said. The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts tostabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the sixweeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise againstthe dollar despite massive central bank intervention. Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness inthe Louvre accord, he said, ""I don't think so. If there had beenno intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."" Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawsonsaid, ""the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode... but one has to be vigilant."" He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that""current levels"" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been""carefully worded."" ""We know what we mean, and we all mean thesame thing,"" he said. Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanesemeasures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source ofweakness for that agreement. Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa'spresentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulatedomestic demand. They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediateincrease in public works spending, but Lawson said the packagealso involved a second stage to increase expenditures duringthe second half of this year.

7,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng warned Japan that the failure to remove a longstanding import quota on Japanese beef might spark a protectionistresponse in the United States. ""Given the protectionist mood in the Congress and thecountry, if I were a leader in Japan I would certainly be veryconcerned...and the failure to remove it (the beef quota) mightbe very serious,"" Lyng told a group of U.S cattlemen. Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,during a visit to Japan later this month, will demand ""totalelimination"" of the beef import quota by April 1988. The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor maystrengthen the U.S. stance in farm trade negotiations, Lyngsaid, because Japan does not want a trade war with the U.S. Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan mightretaliate against U.S. products as a result of thesemiconductor dispute. ""They (Japan) aren't going to pick a fight with us,"" Lyngsaid, adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japanhas more to lose in a trade war than the United States.

He said in addition to beef, the U.S. will press foreliminiation of import barriers on Japan's citrus and rice aswell. Lyng noted that Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. farmproducts, principally grains and soybeans. "

The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em>for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder EddieAntar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canadaannounced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private. Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues andprofits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into thehighly competitive New York City retail market for consumerelectronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes ofelectronics retailers have sagged. The analysts questioned whether Houston-based EntertainmentMarketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whosepresent buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, hadthe management expertise for retailing or was merely trying todrive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns. ""I have mixed feelings,"" said analyst Dennis Telzrow ofEppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. ""On the one handit's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, doesEntertainment Marketing have the management talent to run itand will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"" ""It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,"" saidanalyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, aMinneapolis brokerage. ""Electronics retailing is very managementconcentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management inplace."" Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing alreadyowns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it maybe trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its7-dlr-a-share offer. Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid wasannounced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a sharein over-the- counter trading.  Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New YorkCity, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month thathis group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares. A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has takenno decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrssince they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. Hewould not comment on the new offer. Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such asdisk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods toretailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly toconsumers by cable television.

Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said ina statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchaseof Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc toassist in financing the balance.

3,"Chicago Board of trade grain traders andanalysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned tohandle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of newcrop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeansin the futures markets. Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers willbe more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans becausecorn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That givesdeficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low. Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if theysign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees. With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thingrather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new cropsoybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans moreattractive under normal circumstances. An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift thelimited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mlnmore oat acres this year than last without being penalized,traders said. Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking ofshifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to themore attractive deal from the government, they added. Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just sixmonths ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South toput soybean land back into cotton. One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybeanproduction in recent years has been a general shift of acres intraditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

The two ministers were speaking at a news conference aftersigning an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitationof the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drillingwill begin in September. ""The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not onlyfor this emergency period but for the next five years, withpossibility of an extension.

1,"The United States' dependency onforeign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum IndustryResearch Associates. Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conferencehere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as muchas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous highlevel of 47 pct in 1977. ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil isinevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oilimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to40 pct by 1990. ""However, the rate of this growth can be affectedpositively or negatively through government action orinaction,"" Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government's negative actions isthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cashflow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floorprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices. ""An international floor price adopted by all or mostindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effectivemeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than ifwe imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as syntheticfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessenU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit thewillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said. Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offertax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the StrategicPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plansfor alternative energy. "

0,"Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon GroupInc &lt;REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for GilletteCo that could draw some big international players and in theprocess make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analystssaid. Several hours before a regularly scheduled board ofdirectors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requestedconsent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs pershare. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed inNovember not to buy stock for 10 years without permission. ""I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette andmore interested in putting Gillette into play because he standsto make a ton of money,"" said Andrew Shore, analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. ""In play"" is a term used on Wall Street todescribe what happens when a company becomes an unwilingtakeover target. Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlongets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette throughNovember of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs pershare. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain ofthree yesterday. The agreement would be calculated on the basis ofPerelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for asplit. For example, a deal between Gillette and some othercompany at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmenreturned telephone calls seeking comment. ""Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money ifsomeone else takes over Gillette,"" said Analyst Deepak Raj ofMerrill Lynch and Co. ""I'm not saying that is going to happenbut Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45dlrs per share."" Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasonswhy Perelman may not be really interested in acquiringGillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlonprivate after acquiring control of the cosmetics company twoyears ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon'soperations.

1,"Energy Secretary John Herrington hasproposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he saidall would cost the Treasury money and will come under closeWhite House scrutiny before action is taken. One measure he said he favored would raise the depletionallowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well asproduction using enhanced extraction methods. Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending thetax code, but would look at the proposal. Herrington's proposals to spur production were made alongwith the release last week of the energy department's report onenergy and the national security. The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damagingimplications for national security. He has said since in speeches and at news conferences thatany plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil productionwould have to meet three criteria--increase production, notcause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer. Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,spurring production but fail the second and third. He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oilprices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwideand cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs. A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteriaby not increasing domestic production. In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remainsfirmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax. Options which meet Herrington's criteria include: - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults byborrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that ifoil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults thatcould cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs. - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. Itwould raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year. - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysicalexpenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels aday, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs. - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage tospur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre forthe typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lowerthe cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs. Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administrationproposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cutthe need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily. He also called again for Congressional approval to exploreoff the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billionbarrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, whichmay hold nine billion barrels. Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of theseproposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/securitystudy would make a strong case for the need to help thestruggling domestic oil industry. Another move Herrington said he will press anew, eventhough it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is toraise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000. This, he said, would further bolster national security incase of an oil-supply disruption. "

The parallel market, although tolerated, is technicallyillegal. For the past year, the dollar in the parallel marketis being sold at 25 to 100 pct above the official rate. Sarney's decision means that Brazilian importers ofmachinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency inthe parallel market without having to wait for the issuing ofan official order from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign TradeDepartment (Cacex). Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in aneffort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviatethe risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of theeconomy.

2,"Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hopedto maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth tothe 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despitecontinuing investments in a reorganization program and effortsto extend world penetration. Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mlnguilders, after 265 mln in 1985. Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe'sleading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters. The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total. Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weakerforeign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders. Further consolidation of foreign companies, including theincrease of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El AguilaS.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularlyin French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. Thecompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year inrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said. Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profitnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations hadalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year. Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by theEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beerinto the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beermarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. ""Wehave the beer, but distribution and sales is the importantpoint,"" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heinekenhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures. ""The question is not if we want to penetrate the Germanmarket, but how we are to do it,"" van Schaik said, adding thatwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing ataste for foreign beer, the internal structure was veryregionalized.  Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible forAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the mostimportant beer growth markets in the long term.  He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and withmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, washampered by the lack of hard currencies there. Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine litersper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictionsand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total1986 sales. On-site production is rendered expensive by the high priceof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientistshave been looking at other possibilities. To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched onthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, whichhad sold successfully, Coebergh said. Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional rawmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer werepopular in Rwanda . ""This is a possibility, but we could notpossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,"" Coebergh said. Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts topenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in acontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced. But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken'smarket potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow thatare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept westernmoney. "

2,"J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said itsfirst-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting itspreviously announced decision to place on non-accrual statusits 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interestpayments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in thefirst three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securitiesunderwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mlndlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other tradinglosses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading andunderwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remaineddifficult last quarter, with floating rate notes sufferingheavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whetherMorgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loanlosses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreignexchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln andtrust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees andcommissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but netinvestment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the firstquarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fellto 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which meansthat interest can be recorded as income only when payments areactually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resumepayments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.

1,"Texaco Inc's oil and gas reservesdeclined in 1986 despite reduced production and upwardrevisions in the company's previous reserve estimates, itsannual report said. The statement of the report's auditor was qualified -- aswas the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact ofthe judgement won by Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> against Texaco oncharges Texaco interfered with Pannzoil's contract to acquireGetty Oil Co. The auditor's point out, as Texaco has in the past, thecompany's loss of any of several pending court decisions inthis case could cause it ""to face prospects such as having toseek protection of its assets and business pursuant to thebankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11"" of thefederal bankruptcy code. Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reducedPennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs,Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by theappeals court no later than March 30. Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the companyand its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrelsat the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier. However, inclusion of Texaco's equity in the EasternHemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited thedecline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of1985. Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiariesdeclined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 andupward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mlnbarrels from 117 mln, respectively. Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the UnitedStates -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from1.55 billion. The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, withabout 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day --representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed inresponse to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986.

Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operatingsubsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, areaffected, it said. But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 centsper share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repaymentson debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs. Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers weredemanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as aresult of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>. Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bondof more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almostmatches the damages awarded against Texaco. Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could beginto attach its assets to secure the judgment. Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cutTexaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back tothe Texas courts. Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze allTexaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits ofthe Pennzoil lawsuit. ""Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bondissue and the larger dispute failed,"" James Kinnear, Texaco'spresident and chief executive officer, told reporters. Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers onFriday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing untilthe end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11. Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cashbond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct ofearnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would notsell any assets, Kinnear said. Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter ofcredit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under11.1 billion dlrs, he added. Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said thecompany had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco onSaturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed forbankruptcy. He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing aconfidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""Texacotold us they would get back to us but instead they chose to goto bankruptcy court,"" Jamail said. Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company wouldprevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets wereample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full. "

Regarding trade imbalances, Volcker said that it wascritically important that markets be kept open by theindustrial nations.

5,"One or two large West German bankseffectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity atthe end of the month in order to achieve higher rates fromtheir overnight deposits, money dealers said. As a result, call money soared in active trading to aroundthe Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday asbanks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds. Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at thecentral bank over the first 29 days of the month. Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion. To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raiseholdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today andtomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business becausebanks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale ofTreasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct forthree-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market. Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not returnuntil tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said. Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,commanded short-term money requirements of as much as fivebillion marks or so. With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of themonth, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,draining liquidity for three days. When other banks soughtfunds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excessfunds on deposit at a considerably higher average return. One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advancedknowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed itssales of treasury bills on Friday. Though dealers only late in the day learn of the totalminimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbankhas an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipatethe strength of demand for funds the following day, he said. ""(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are notselling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in thisamount,"" he said. ""If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer themarket then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it willbe different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so."" But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump inrates, given the delicate state of currency markets. International central banks have been at pains to prevent adollar fall against major currencies, including the mark.Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmerundertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar. ""The whole tender policy is to have a call money of betweenthree and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have todaycannot be very popular,"" the senior dealer said. Dealers said the large banks probably achieved averagerates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct orfour pct. This is a higher return than they would have earnedwithout the excessive draining through the treasury billmechanism. Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiationsbetween Germany's major employers and the unions, theBundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes tomonetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said. Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on theLombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billionmarks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business. "

7,"Rising imports of Japanese-made cars andelectronic goods may upset West European officials, but theygenerally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latesttrade row between the United States and Japan. Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe,as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair tradepractices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold. The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficitwith Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanesetrade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said. But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of actingwith the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus. ""The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is theU.S.,"" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade PolicyResearch Centre in London. ""Basically, their policies are prettymuch the same."" But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Orthat the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage ofthe U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said. ""In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,"" headded. ""In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic offree competition, while in Europe, the general approach is thatliberal trade is good because it makes countries rich."" Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington'stendency to impose so-called ""countervailing duties"" - an importtax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair. In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends tobe to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said. In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan hasthreatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronicgoods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan hasfailed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade. But the European Community has challenged the agreement asa violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.

7,"The threatened trade war between theUnited States and Japan is just the kind of shock thateconomists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin. But they are not so sure if that would be a briefcorrective dip, or whether this week's falling share pricesmark the start of a ""bear"" market. ""It's the billion dollar question,"" said Richard O'Brien,economist at American Express International Bank in London. Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- haspoured into share and bond markets around the world, and fundeda good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third ofany new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by theJapanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as thedollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets itfall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart ofimproving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar orbecause the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budgetdeficit.   And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese willhave less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill thegap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. Thesubsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major fallson the world stock markets. ""A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,""said O'Brien. ""Now, it is much less certain."" Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a boomingeconomy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best inthe industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt andhuge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien. Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of SmithBarney Harris Upham said  ""We're still in a bull market,"" addingthat corrections are a normal part of a rising market and ""Thebear usually strikes slowly."" Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co inLondon, said the huge sums of money going through the worldfinancial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices. Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money innon-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's verydifficult to see where else they can put their money than inU.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,according to David Butcher, a senior executive at YamaichiSecurities Co Ltd's bond operation in London. He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention nowto the French franc and West German mark. In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions andthe dollar's slide will mean for securities markets. "

1,"Firmer crude oil prices, government aidpackages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oilindustry recover from last year sharp downturn, industryanalysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices droppedabout 50 pct. On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared totheir highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading atrecord highs. ""This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on thepart of the investment community that the outlook for theindustry for the future is extremely attractive,"" Peters and CoLtd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies,culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of lastyear's results, analysts said. ""But the financial statements are a snap shot and arecording of history. The stock market is the indication of thefuture,"" Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15at the end of 1986. Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares ofImperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, istrading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4.Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, isat 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecastsoperating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gascompanies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrsand operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billiondlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S.dlrs a barrel. ""However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs abarrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increasewith cash flow 27 pct higher,"" analyst Plexman said. ""Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of theprofit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,""he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, whenoperating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will holdrecent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director HansMaciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987,after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crudeoil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPECproduction accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industryoutlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecastimproved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued thisweek, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. ""The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but notrobust,"" Texaco Canada said in its annual report. ""While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there isgood reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,continued volatility is likely,"" Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies havepared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels,deferring most frontier exploration work. ""The industry is becoming very selective in investments,very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,""Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushionthe industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when thefederal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax(PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oilcompanies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flowdecline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented furtherexploration spending cuts, analysts said. ""For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutelynecessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments thatwere made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerablymore,"" Maciej said.

The high court justices reversed a ruling by a U.S. Courtof Appeals in Chicago that struck down the 1986 control-shareacquisition law. The case involved a hostile takeover bid by Dynamics Corpof America against CTS Corp, based in Elkhart, Ind. Dynamics made a tender offer in 1985 for one million sharesto bring its holdings of CTS stock to 27.5 pct of the company'stotal.    After CTS invoked the state law, Dynamics filed a lawsuitchallenging the constitutionality of the measure. One effect of the law is to impose a 50-day delay on thetender offer at the option of the target company. It also requires that the acquisition for control shares inan Indiana corporation does not include voting rights unless amajority of all pre-existing shareholders so agree at theirnext regularly scheduled meeting. Justice Lewis Powell, writing for the court majority, heldthat the state law was not pre-empted by federal securitieslaw.    ""The Indiana Act protects independent shareholders from thecoercive aspects of tender offers by allowing them to vote as agroup,"" he said. He acknowledged that the law may delay some tender offersand may decrease the number of successful tender offers forIndiana corporations.

0,"Citicorp has extended its reachinto the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisitionof 50 of Sears Roebuck's &lt;S> Sears Savings Bank branches,bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities,CitiCorp Savings said. Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by theFederal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and showsits serious intent to penetrate the California market. The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach intoSouthern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located.Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California. ""This marks our first major expansion in California,particularly in the south,"" said Citicorp Savings PresidentEdward Valencia, in a statement. Thrift industry sources said they do not see a majornear-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, butdo expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor thanSears was in that market. ""We do believe they will be a better competitor thanSears,"" said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of HomeFederal Savings and Loan Association &lt;HFD>, based in San Diego. Banking industry sources said the move is viewed asgroundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the Californiamarket, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it tooperate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely toconvert the branches to banks at that time.

7,"Republican members of the HouseAgriculture Committee said they will propose amendmentstomorrow to a pending trade bill increasing funding for theexport enhancement program, EEP, and significantly expandingthe scope of the program. At a press conference, Republican lawmakers said they wouldpropose expanding EEP to include all countries ""willing topurchase additional commodities at reasonable prices."" In addition, the Congressmen said they would proposeextending the life of EEP to five years from the current threeyears and increasing the EEP funding ceiling to 2.5 billiondlrs from 1.5 billion at present. The Agriculture committee tomorrow will begin draftingamendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the House. Responding to the Republican plan, Agriculture SecretaryRichard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said theyfavor a flexible, targeted use of EEP instead of anacross-the-board program which they termed too costly. The Republican Congressmen also said they will offer anamendment to the trade bill instructing the U.S. AgricultureDepartment to value the bonus commodities used for EEP at themarket value, rather than the cost of acquisition. But Lyng said USDA already plans to change to market valueaccounting rather than acquisition value, in order to avoidhitting a funding ceiling for eep of 1.5 billion dlrs. Lyng said under market value accounting only about 700 mlndlrs of EEP commodities have been used to date. Usingacquisition value, USDA officials said the value is higher. "

0,"A 3.22 billion dlr offer for DomePetroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the doorfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said. Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations. TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added. ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward,"" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada's proposed offer. "

7,"Leading domestic semiconductor makerswill boost imports and cut production of key memory microchipsfrom next month in line with government attempts to ward offU.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said. The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off thesanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of theplans, analysts said. The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth ofproducts and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure tohonour a semiconductor trade pact. In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagansaid Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatorypricing and open Japan's market to foreign products. But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter saidyesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to dropthe tariffs if Japan shows a ""clear indication"" that it will openits markets to U.S. Goods. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) hasurged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in thesecond quarter, following a call to reduce production by morethan 20 pct the previous quarter. MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports. Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington tocancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan. ""The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its swordand shown that it can and will do business,"" said analyst NickEdwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo. But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers cancut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal ofthe sanctions -- is more difficult. ""The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's(integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumerproducts. They're well supplied here,"" said Richard May, senioranalyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo. The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's,but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-endproduction skills, the analysts said. ""The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses onsemiconductors in return for free access to other areas,"" saidEdwards. A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T>, said the firm'sreduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory(256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off thetrade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result ofthe company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said. Company officials unveiled the following plans - - NEC Corp &lt;NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans toslash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct tosix mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln lastquarter.

Thecompany is trying to boost imports but has not set a specifictarget. Imports are currently very low. - Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAMproduction by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and isconsidering ways to boost imports, a company official said. Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sellthe U.S. Firm's chips in Japan.

1,"Japanese oil traders generally expect oilprices to remain steady through June, when the nextOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec) meetingis scheduled to take place. Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than amonth, despite coming under considerable pressure in Februaryas Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks stronglyresist paying official prices, trade sources said. Despite these attempts, spot crude rose steadily tostabilize around OPEC's 18 dlr a barrel target, they said. Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month,mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and memberswould submit to pressure to discount prices, oil traders said. However, Opec's discipline in holding its price and outputtargets eventually forced many of the buyers back, they said. Countries such as Qatar, Iran and Iraq refused to bend todemands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-liftingfrom Japanese buyers. The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vesselsto store its production rather than cut its prices, they said. Opec's March production was 14.6 mln bpd, 1.2 mln below itsceiling, with Saudi Arabia's output just below 3.0 mln bpdcompared to its Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd, the Middle EastEconomic Survey estimated. ""Of course there was a little cheating but not enough todestroy the market,"" an oil trader in Tokyo said. Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market atdiscounted prices through barter deals and the swapping ofMiddle East grades for North Sea cargoes, but these trades havenot generated sufficient volume to depress the market, he said. The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20to 25 cts below official prices, so resistance to buying crudeunder term contracts in the second quarter is likely to beweaker, traders said. Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said todayOPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present outputvolume at 15.8 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly, orraising the production ceiling so members can produce more inthe third and fourth quarters of 1987.

Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texacofiling on crude futures trading although they said the exchangemight lower Texaco's position limit and require higher marginsfor Texaco's trades.

5,"The Bundesbank's options for WestGermany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable futureby the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions andemployers, economists and money market dealers said. Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pcttreasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached. But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikelyto encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely forfear of upsetting the current wage round. One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, ""Idon't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whateverhappens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all itwants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes."" In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the groundfor triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessmentsof growth and inflation, economists said. Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if theBundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in themedium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands. As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no movethat would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said. In the current round, the country's most powerful union,the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, isdemanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from thepresent 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages. The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, isoffering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and givea two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 thisyear and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988. The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largestunion, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set thebenchmark for settlements in other industries such as thepublic sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiationsbegan in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude byearly April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June. Though many economists said the unions' current warningstrikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy andwould not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-weekstrikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly ontheir positions and there could still be conflict. This could extend the length of time in which theBundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said. The money market head said the unions' humiliation by theprotracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperativehousing venture would contribute to union obstinacy. ""The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put thissquarely onto the account in the negotiations,"" he said. In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metallunion, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined thanhis predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battleto achieve the best possible settlement for his membership. More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly insouth Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hoursyesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH andaerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH. Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out inwarning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said. Money market dealers said that overnight call money rateswould rise in the near future in any case and did not depend ona politically-inhibited Bundesbank. About eight billion marks were coming into the markettomorrow from salary payments by the federal government. As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offerto mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,anticipating still lower rates before the month-end. But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customerswas due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short ofliquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling. Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement. "
4,"Remarks by two leading central bankerssparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut inthe West German three pct discount rate may be underdiscussion, currency dealers said. Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech thatmonetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflowsrequired cuts in interest rates. Separately, West Berlin state central bank president DieterHiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall belowits lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he wasnot making a forecast on interest rates, however. Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollargained slight background support from the speculation. But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the moneymarket this week, dashing some expectations that it may eitheroffer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rateand let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate. It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much lessthan the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pactexpired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank couldmove to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said. Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculativecapital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless ofwhether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell. ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity."" Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of thegenerally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked thefirst time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as acounterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said."

The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabiaand the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank said the improvement would result from higher oilprices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrainoverall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eightdollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.

7,"The inflow of long-term capital intoWest Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February fromJanuary's record 11.91 billion, with foreign purchases ofGerman bonds and shares declining sharply, the Bundesbank said. While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth ofGerman bonds in February after 13 billion in January, they solda net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of publicauthorities after sales worth 300 mln in January. With German investors' purchases of foreign securitiessteady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks wereimported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion. Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60billion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January. There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-termcapital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January. Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds whiledomestic companies increased their short-term financial assetsabroad by 700 mln. But public authorities received some onebillion marks from abroad, the Bundesbank said in a statement. Combining long and short term capital outflows, WestGermany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks inFebruary against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January.

Seasonally adjusted,the February current account surplus narrowed against January. While exports in February fell a half pct against the samemonth last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to thedrop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and importstwo pct. In the balance of services, a fall in net investment incomeled to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln marksurplus in January. The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billionmarks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the EuropeanCommunity budget. "

The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serveclients in the region and educate financial markets about theadvantages of currency options, Giordano said. Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour byexchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of theexchange-trade currency option market against existingover-the-counter option trading during the local working day. Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had becomean accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk andhad grown in popularity, he said. The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, includinga new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30billion U.S. Dlrs. Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with theperformance of its Australian dollar contract, which since itsintroduction last year had regularly topped the French franc asthe third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000contracts traded daily.
