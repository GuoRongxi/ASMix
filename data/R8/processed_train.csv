He told reporters that volumes in North America increasedsome 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pctafter being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentratingactivities on core businesses, had now been completed, henoted. But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategicacquisitions taking place ""from time to time,"" he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-taxprofits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level droppedthree pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion. Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc<CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring anyearnings dilution. However, it would not add much to profits, with much of thecompany's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs. Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about40 pct by end-1987. The same divergence was made in full year dividend, withUnilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and UnileverPlc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line withthe change in attributable profit. Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts ofChesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he saidthat there was no target date for completing the process. He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped torealise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough hadpaid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, whichoperates outside Unilever's core activities.

4,"U.S. bank reserve, monetary anddiscount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reservetoday clearly indicate that policy is ""on hold"" and may not bechanged for weeks or even months, economists said. ""The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is notabout to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurson the economy,"" said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co. ""These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is inprospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue forpolicy change,"" said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc. Fed data released today were all in line with economists'expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks. The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the twoweeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mlndlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changedfrom 160 mln dlrs in the period before that. It said that banks' net free reserves in the latest twoweeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously. Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs. Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actualpositive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3. February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limitsset by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target. ""In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for theFed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in moneygrowth,"" said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman GovernmentSecurities Inc. Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetarygrowth in March after February's anemic growth rates. However,they stress that money growth will not be strong enough toprevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if theeconomy shows evidence of weakness. Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate,Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in moneymarket deposits at banks. This number has risen three to fourbillion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February'sweakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March. Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should returnto the five to seven pct annualized growth region and socontinue to present no problem for the Fed. Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable withits current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhapsseveral more months of economic data before deciding whether ornot to ease its grip on reserves. Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analystsagreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will chooseto raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it nextchanges policy. ""Discount window borrowings in the past week were about aslow as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above sixpct,"" said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pctin the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week. The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs onMonday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it addedreserves directly through two-day System repurchases. Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds ratebe largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on aborrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs. "

0,"The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tenderoffer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not beenough to buy the company, analysts said. Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from GeneralPartners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value ofGenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertaintysurrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges toGencorp broadcasting licenses. Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading. ""The expectation is either there will be someone else orthe bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management'scooperation,"" said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Huttongroup. Analysts said there is concern about challenges toGencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radiostations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign paymentsand political contributions. ""I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,""said Baker of the offer. Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issuemight be a stumbling block or result in a long period of timefor any transaction. A source close to General Partners, however, said GeneralPartners would apply to the Federal Communications Commissionfor special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.The source said if approved, the authority would allow atransaction to be carried out. If it received the ""short-form"" approval, General Partnerswould set up a trust which would hold the broadcastingproperties until the licensing situation is resolved. General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner andBrown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc. Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such asGeneral Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution ofthe challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sellthe stations. GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with WaltDisney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to agroup that challenged the station's license. GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV inSecaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs. General Partners said it intends to keep the company'splastics and industrial products businesses and its tires andrelated products segment. Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, saidthat, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth asmuch as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospacebusiness could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billiondlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs pershare, he said. The company, formerly known as General Tireand Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would beworth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottlingbusiness might also be worth several dollars per share, hesaid. Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, whobecame chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company'sAerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over theyears and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve. ""The management's doing a very fine job in trying to dealwith the non-strategic assets of the company,"" Rose said. Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, butthey declined to predict what steps the company might take.They said it would be possible the company might consider aleveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer. General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and therewas some concern about ""greenmail."" Greenmail is the payment ata premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock. ""I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothingsurprises me anymore,"" said Rose. GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retainedFirst Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers. "

The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut inbanks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said thishad been largely discounted and was not likely to detract fromthe current popularity of sterling-denominated investments. ""Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month andwe're set to see many more eurosterling deals,"" one dealer said.

This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who havetapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as theKingdom of Sweden today, continental banks includingCommerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations.

The recent Australian proposals were a good starting pointfor discussions, ""but we do not want the Australians to feelthey are alone in developing an agenda for discussions"" on worldgrain trade, the president of the National Association of WheatGrowers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates saidin a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. Future discussions on international wheat trade shouldinclude three topics -- a commitment to privatization ofgovernment-run export trading entities, a commitment to publicdisclosure of sales and other terms if government entities areinvolved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, thetwo organizations said  While the Australian proposals are welcome the twoorganizations said they are not in total agreement with theirassessments. Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. targetprices and ""quarantine"" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue toplace the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.farmers, they said.   Other countries, including Australia, have benefittedfrom the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S.acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said. ""We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- andsubsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stockinggrain and changing programs which protect our growers,"" JimMiller, president of NAWG said.

4,"The Indian Finance Ministry'sannouncement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation'sinterest rate structure, will benefit industry and agricultureby providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said. The changes, effective today, included reducing commercialbank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pctby one percentage point. New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, alsoinclude a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, ondeposits of two years or more but less than five. Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pctinterest have been abolished. Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect thegovernment's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and helpimprove world competitiveness of Indian goods. There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank depositsby long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will createthe flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equityshares or short-term bank deposits, they said.

5,"The European Monetary System marks itseighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world moneymarkets despite creating an island of currency rate stabilityin Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,which holds eight European Community currencies within narrowfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), hasbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alikeseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu asEurope's common currency took a step nearer to becoming realitywhen Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so farblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system'sfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt andformer French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two yearsafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have beentransferred from national governments and central banks to anautonomous European Monetary Fund.   But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty ineconomic and monetary matters. ""The basic problem of the EMS isthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to asituation where certain decisions are taken in common,"" said oneeconomist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy onthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is thesystem's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged andinvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharprise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose againstEMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And asWest Germany last year refused to give in pressure from severalEC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slowthe mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to easefinancial and trade strains within the community. Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revaluedby three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pctagainst other currencies in the system -- the French franc,Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown.   Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend theEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major worldcurrency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expectedbefore the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since itwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC'shighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of CentralBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministershold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involvemore than tinkering with technical details. They are scepticalabout the chances for any fundamental change. ""Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMSagainst external factors such as dollar weakness. For that wemust take the step forward to the institutional level,"" said Leode Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will dependlargely on the success of an agreement last month among majorindustrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollarresumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, theypredict. "

1,"The ""cross field allowance"" relief onPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRTpaying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co. The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct ofqualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability ofother fields. It is restricted to new offshore developmentsoutside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval. A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field notpaying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directlybenefit in PRT saving on an existing field. ""The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participatorsin those fields which have no PRT liability,"" the report said,adding that the timing of development of such fields may beadvanced. The government would in effect be subsidising thesedevelopments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure beforecorporation tax, the report said. On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit isof timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields willbe reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields willrise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said. In a study on probable fields, the report said that whenthe rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-payingfield such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in theU.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for asmall non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9pct. The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there willbe a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not onlywill these costs be unavailable for offset against the field'sfuture profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs willbe lost. Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development startswill have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a latertime. "

Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a 1.4billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAirtakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close toaccepting the bid. Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer andsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in itstakeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment. Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA wasoff 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spreadit would be taken over. Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attemptto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract asuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.   ""The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer orPiedmont and USAir announce a deal,"" speculated one arbitrager. Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the currentprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid willsucceed. Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, NorfolkSouthern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for thecompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half ofPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance. Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price ofPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline isdestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is theleast likely to be bought. Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation inthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of athree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont. But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn'soffer, which lacked financing and was riddled withcontingencies. Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of twoairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA. ""You can't discount him,"" said one arbitrager. Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he isserious by following through with his threats or making a newoffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to godirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lowerprice if USAir rejected his offer. ""It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,"" saidone arbitrager. Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced byabout six dlrs per share. Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airlinecombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, butothers believe it could be cleared if the companies areacquired separately. ""TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal towork,"" said one analyst. Analysts said such a merger would be costly andcomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahnsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions. In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wagescale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,analysts said. Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, theysaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be anecessary ingredient for a merger to work. However, other analysts speculated the managements ofPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a newcompany. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a wayfor him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then mergedinto TWA. "

4,"Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balancedby analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement. A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expectedtomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. Afollow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week. ""Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,"" Peter Fellner,U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. ""It wasa very, very prudent fiscal budget."" Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was awell-balanced budget within the confines of the government'sphilosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat. Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscalside, but offered nothing new on monetary policy. As was widely expected, Lawson split his ""fiscal adjustment""between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stgfrom 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to27 pct. The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, waskept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broadSterling M3 aggregate was dropped. Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way fora half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but theauthorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a fullone-point cut tomorrow. ""The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action whichit will have to reverse later,"" Jeffrey said, though he added afurther half-point cut was quite possible in the near future. The main worry from today's speech is the outlook forinflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy containedin it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said. Holt noted the ""rather loose"" inflation forecast of 4.0 pctat end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to resultfrom the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern. ""A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,""he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back offalling base rates would have an offsetting impact oninflation. The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence butit was ""not a good budget for inflation,"" he said Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more aboutthe dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was nottoo concerned about a revival of inflation. Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the""leading edge"" of monetary policy, but said the authorities werelikely to be extremely cautious on this front. He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interestrates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed anysigns of excessive weakness. Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibilityof the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts. Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility bythe favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecastto be 4.0 billion stg. But analysts said the Budget speech did not give anyclear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,which has to be held before June, 1988. Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that thebenefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raiseduties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately. But others said it kept several options open and it was notpossible to deduce too much from it. James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election inthat there would be no ""chickens coming home to roost."" Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a Juneelection, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone fora Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory. Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boostto the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity. "

0,"U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra DayO'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunctionblocking the planned merger of Delta &lt;DAL> AirlinesInc and Western Airlines &lt;WAL>, the Court said. O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel ofthe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco hadblocked the merger until a dispute over union representationhad been settled by arbitration. A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay ofthe injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs,to go through as planned later today. The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Eachof the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over aparticular regional Appellate circuit and has the power toprovisionally overturn its rulings without comment. The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials ofAtlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the mergerfor months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanesbelonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles. ""Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,""Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution latelast night. ""There was really very little that remained to bedone."" The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had beenfiled in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air TransportEmployees union sought to force Western's management to fulfilla promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger tookplace. The airlines argued that Western's promise could not beenforced in a takeover by a larger company. After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officialslast night spread the word by telephone that Western employeesshould report for work today in their old uniforms, not in newDelta outfits. Delta announced last September that it was purchasingWestern. The merger took place in December, and Western hasbeen operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Westernname was to have disappeared at midnight last night. At issue is whether the Western unions would continue torepresent Western employees after the integration of the twoairlines. While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees areunionized, only Delta's pilots are union members. Delta had maintained that the three unions having contractswith Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and theTeamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be""extinguished"" after today.

7,"The United States will likely imposesanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators saidtoday after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige. Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decisionwould be taken until a final determination is made on whetherJapanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they saidthey were virtually sure Japan would face penalties. President Reagan's trade policy advisory group, of whichBaldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday. ""I am confident we will see action taken,"" Sen. John McCain,an Arizona Republican, told reporters. ""I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more thansanctions,"" Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said. The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductorindustry representatives met with Baldrige and State Departmentofficials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the UnitedStates and other countries. They recommended Japanese firms be penalized throughtariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months forcontinuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said. Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen.Pete Wilson told reporters, ""The clear import of what he said isthat there will be."" ""Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctionsmust be applied,"" for past violations of the agreement, theCalifornia Republican said. The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chipswhich are used in high technology products ranging from radiosto defence missile guidance systems. Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige toldthem the administration had not made a final determination thatJapanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips belowthe cost of production in the United States or other countries. But McClure said senators told him, ""There is no doubtdumping is going on,"" based on evidence such as invoices ofpurchases of the Japanese products. The two countries signed a pact last September in whichJapan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the UnitedStates and other countries below production costs and to allowthe U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market. In return, the United States waived its right to imposeimport duties on the Japanese microchips. Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pactand have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output tosave the pact. Japan has frequently been the target of congressionaldiscouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr tradedeficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the UnitedStates last year and had large surpluses with other countries. The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolutioncalling for action against Japan for violations of the pactsince September. The resolution will be introduced in the Housenext week by Rep.

They said it would take about two months and at least 15mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador toPuerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombianpipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia'sPacific Ocean coast. The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed totransport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) ofEcuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said. The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room forEcuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadoreanenergy ministry official said. The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped byboat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domesticdemand. The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador toresume some of production, paralysed since March six by an earthquake the night before. The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungleoilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the PacificOcean. Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before theearthquake.

7,"Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost itseconomy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washingtonto take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remainingrestrictions two weeks ago. Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdownof the figure, saying it takes into account a number ofhypothetical losses. Some of them are ""too sophisticated toconvert into financial terms,"" one banking source said. But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions isimpossible to calculate. They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland'seconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory. ""Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they onlycontributed to largely internal, economic problems,"" one said. The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most FavouredNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliationfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union undermartial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy wasoriginally devised several years ago by the Institute ofNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planningcommission. According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polisheconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growthtrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases incredits from Western commercial and government lenders. But the calculations were based on a time when trade wasbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissingthe estimate as ""a theoretical projection based on a high point,which has no real scientific evaluation."" A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports tothe U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrsannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions wereimposed. Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling tradesurplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrsagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show. Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland importantU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say creditsdried up for economic not political reasons.  ""Poland isaccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate forpolitical reasons,"" said one expert. ""It's an illusion based on amisunderstanding of Western economy."" ""There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someonewho has no hope of repaying it,"" another said, adding thatPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy creditsin the 1970s which were no longer today's reality. Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as ""nebulous,"" onediplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical ordersand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing ofscientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say thelifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impacton Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrsand lacks the means to modernise its industry. ""MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will notbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult toregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces arein play now,"" said one Western envoy. He said Polish products were not competitive, and theirquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionistmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamperPoland's efforts to regain entry. Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognisedthis fact recently. Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, ""Makingup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonlydifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period oftwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level ofexports by only about 100 mln dlrs."" While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says ithas a ""moral right"" to assistance from the U.S. Which it saysimposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said""The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoingof the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans willjust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushingSolidarity."" Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, intalks in Washington last week with the International MonetaryFund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland waslooking for a lead from the United States. He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet itsfinancial obligations to the United States, ""but not in a shorttime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of itsforeign economic partners."" He stressed that the U.S. ""had a particular opportunity toplay a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partnersinterested in the settlement of Polish debt."" Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamedWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF andParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years andsaid it should now play a more positive role. ""As a major superpower the United States can influenceinternational organisations,"" he said, citing recent meetingsaimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent towhich Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

4,"U.S. economic data this week could bethe key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures breakout of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said. Although market expectations are for February U.S. retailsales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthygains, figures within or slightly below expectations would bepositive for the market, the analysts said. ""You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bondsright now,"" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst CraigSloane. Treasury bond futures came under pressure today whichtraders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and arise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interestto break below chart support in the June contract failed tomaterialize, participants who had sold bond futures earlyquickly covered short positions, they said. ""Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come inas expected it won't be that bad for the market,"" Sloane said. Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sectorof retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct. Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figurebelow market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, andshe put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up0.8 to 1.2 pct. Industrial production and the producer price index Fridayboth are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, sheadded. Retail sales ""will tell us whether or not we will be ableto fill the gap,"" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in Junebonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bondsclosed at 100-4/32 today. Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to thefederal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, saidCarroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer. ""A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded themarket from breaking out of the trading range the last time themarket approached the top of the range,"" Singer said. In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,which is just below 102 in the June contract, ""the crude oilrally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,""Singer said. ""Fed funds are already easing back down toward thesix pct level."" The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern toManufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rallymay be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said. Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract toease to 99-6/32 and find support. ""I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.The jury is still out this week,"" Rozich said. "

7,"Ministers from more than 20nations were told by New Zealand that the next internationalnegotiations on liberalising trade would be the last thiscentury and the cost of failure could not be measured. Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at awelcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that greatprogress had been made in preparing for the negotiations whichmust not be sidetracked. ""We live in troubled and dangerous times for the worldtrading system,"" he said. ""We have seen that the failure of the world trading systemhas caused great depression and conflict in the past. Ourfailure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to usall,"" Moore said.   ""The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our lasthope and best opportunity this century. We will not get anotherchance before the year 2000,"" he added. The ministers are in New Zealand to review world tradesince the ""Uruguay round"" talks last September. The talks are also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice. The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to havebeen particularly successful, with northern hemispherecountries managing to have service industries such as bankingand insurance included in the next full round. The southerners' goal of including agricultural andtropical products also was met. The meeting at this North Island tourist resort isdescribed by participants as informal and no declaration isexpected. Moore said one aim was to ""instil a sense of politicalurgency to avert potential economic tragedy."" Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade topeople who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see thebenefits, as well as preventing ""bush fires of confrontationwhile we proceed with orderly negotiations."" The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegationsincluding representatives of GATT and the Economic Community. The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter. American sources say he is ready to state that the best wayto reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is toimplement four key Uruguay proposals: -- an end to agricultural subsidies; -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATTregulations; -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-calledintellectual property such as trademarks, patents andcopyrights; -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92member states. Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign TradeMinister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talksfor domestic political reasons.

7,"The White House Economic PolicyCouncil decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan forviolations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement,industry sources said. They would give no details, noting that the White House hadnot commented on the decision. The administration has beenunder pressure to retaliate. There was no immediate announcement on the council'sdecision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the seniorpolicy group's move on curbs reflected growing Americanfrustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices. U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act onthe recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aideson the foreign policy implications of retaliation. The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for alast try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reachedlast July governing trade in semiconductors. Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumpingsemiconductors in world markets and to open its own market toU.S.-made semiconductors. In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumpingduties on Japanese semiconductor shipments. The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S.Market but has continued in third countries, and that theJapanese market remains closed. The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimouscall by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanesehigh technology products containing semiconductors. A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductorindustry and from its chief trade union. U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japanwould involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such astelevisions, video cassette recorders and computers. "

A further 100 mln stg wasreserved for the National Debt Commissioners.

Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against thebackdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rateswhich had built up over the past two weeks as a result ofsterling's strength. The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared tosee lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoonannounced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11pct. The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a ratecut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delaya reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures. However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorableclimb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure andallow a half-point cut. Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the marketas a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further earlyrate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling. Most market participants believe that Lawson will nowfoster a further half point interest rate reduction at the timeof the budget, although one or two said they would not besurprised to see a full point decline at this stage. Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attemptslast week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issueda one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing theGovernment bond market. To the surprise of most participants, the issue was soldout within hours of becoming available for trading and themarket pushed on to register further sharp gains. Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that theissue announced today would be absorbed by the market asrapidly as last week's. However, they noted that although sterling had edged downfrom its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closedon a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300GMT.

The loss included a one-time restructuring charge of 1.7billion dlrs. Olson said he expects ATT's cash flow to remain strongdespite the poor earnings. "

However, the bank said it will maintain the high level ofprovisioning for loan losses established last year because ofmany market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan lossprovisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31. The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basicshare after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.

The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt anagressive posture in adding to its general provisions againstloan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federalgovernment's Inspector General of Banks. First quarter net partly benefitted from net interestincome, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs. Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net incomewas partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions,non-interest expenses and income taxes. The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainlyto continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields. Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986,but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.

0,"Borg-Warner Corp will vigorouslyresist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but theMidwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer,either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe. Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAFthrough a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner'sstock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading. Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman willstage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he canadd its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF. ""It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question isnow do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they wantto remain independent,"" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps. Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculationfor almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle,Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mlnBorg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding. Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took nosteps toward a transaction. ""Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them forthe last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporatebattles I've seen,"" said one analyst. The battle, however, has heated up, and the range ofbreakup values on Wall Street span from the current marketprice to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said theythink a price in the low 50s would be appropriate. Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily onits 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner. Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end upwith Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materialscompany in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted anunsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefitedfrom that company's restructuring. ""Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimateoffer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind ofbetween a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. Ipersonally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs pershare,"" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson. Henderson also speculated the company might attempt arestructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire andRubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir JamesGoldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock andcarried out a wider share repurchase. Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman isseeking ""greenmail,"" or the repurchase of his stock by thecompany at a premium. Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems withfinancing the transaction. Previously associated with ""junk bond"" experts, DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warnertakeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tenderoffer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArnerboard and conditioned on the board's recommendation of thetender offer and merger. Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects amerger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employeessince the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repaydebt from the transaction. GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8.   ""I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at thelevel it is proposing it would enhance GAF share valuessubstantially,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose. He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for thecompany's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF'scurrent holdings. Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings. The plastics are used in telephone equipment, officeequipment and appliances. ""Borg has half the market in the U.S.and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,""Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW> andMonsanto Corp &lt;MTC>, he said. Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and aprotective systems business, which includes Wells Fargosecurity guards. It also has an information services business,and is trying to sell its financial services business. Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share onrevenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986,earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs pershare on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs.

Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the releaseof ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreignearnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance,notably in the securities business. He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock. News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's shareprice on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders. Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely thefuture trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates andABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said. Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1pct to 242 mln guilders, he added. Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earningsmargins via traditional lending activities, he said. Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing riskprovisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overlyconcerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factorwhich brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bankstocks recently. He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financiallytroubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were LatinAmerican countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said. He added that losses incurred through loans to tinproducers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 hadbeen written off. "

3,"The Australian Government will likelyreimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, thedepartment said the sharp fall in world wheat prices hasreduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levelsinsufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated ataround 98 dlrs per tonne.  For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below thebreakeven export price, it said. Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advancepayment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculatedat 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the currentyear and the two lowest of the previous three years, thedepartment said. In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling andstorage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives. But the department said the Australian Bureau ofAgricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production willdrop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in1989/90. The decline will result from low world grain prices leadingto shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.wheat exports, the department said. "

5,"A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasurysupply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering creditmarket, but at least this week's offerings should provide itwith some focus, economists said. ""Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put towork, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,""said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package oftwo-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales blockthis week. The ""mini-refunding,"" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs innew cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes forauction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes onWednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes onThursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- andsix-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs. The mini-refunding does not come at a particularlyauspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been driftingsideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudyU.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change inFederal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar. Moreover, the bond market's inertia has comparedunfavourably with the rash of activity taking place inhigh-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S.Equities. But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there aresigns the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting abit. ""Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side,and there is a marked absence of selling,"" they said in a weeklyreport. Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believesbanks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week'ssales. ""The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings.Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying thesematurities has been wider, it is still positive,"" he said in aweekly market review. But economists agreed not even the auctions will generateenough impetus for a major move. This will only come once theoverseas markets have had their run. ""Based on last week's events, there is little to indicatethat the appetite for yield has begun to wane,"" said economistsat Salomon Brothers Inc. Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investorsare planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of thehigher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal yearon April 1. And while traditionally the Japanese have not been bigbuyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S.Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence. Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadianmonetary authorities to curb the rise of their currenciesshould also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bondmarkets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said. Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven theU.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations,economists said. This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday withFebruary durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound fromJanuary's depressed levels. Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co saidseveral areas, including transport equipment, should havebounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will captotal new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct afterJanuary's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gainas large as five pct. Friday's consumer price report for February is expected toshow an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain.Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind theJanuary rise -- rose more moderately last month, while foodprices declined. Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds ratewill be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to theapproach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date. Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass thisweek because its adding requirement increases sharply in thenew statement period beginning on Thursday. Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expectedto open near that level. "

5,"The dollar is near appropriate levelsagainst European currencies and the yen, and a further fallcould damage confidence in the currency while endangering worldeconomic growth, a top Bundesbank official said. Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Associationconference current exchange rates of major currencies ""can beviewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective."" He said the recent Paris agreement on currencystabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Fiveand Canada may herald ""an era of greater exchange ratestability."" The Paris agreement was not, however, an attempt to set uppermanent target zones for exchange rates, Gleske stressed,adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree andenforce on an international level. ""At present levels the dollar can no longer be consideredgrossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies andthe yen,"" Gleske said. He said the dollar had fallen much less against currenciesof important trading nations such as Canada, Korea, Taiwan andHong Kong, and further falls there may still be necessary. But ""a further dollar depreciation against major Europeancurrencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore thedollar to a fully competitive position, as measured by itsweighted external value,"" he said.   In fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate wouldhold two major dangers, Gleske said. First, in countries with large balance of paymentssurpluses such as Japan and West Germany, it threatened tohamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of realincome and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe outsurpluses. Second, in the United States, it could damage investors'confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness tofinance huge fiscal and external payments deficits, Gleskesaid. Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an internationalsystem of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating innarrow bands against each other, can be established. Suchtargets threatened to cause policy conflicts, ""both withincountries and between them."" For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fundits deficits requires interest rates there be set at highlevels, but domestic considerations call for low ones. If target zones were established, this would put ""pressureon other countries to reduce their interest rates even more,even though this may be in conflict with their own domesticsituation and priorities,"" he said. Gleske added, ""targeting the exchange rate even within awide margin will meet with serious objections where there is aclearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic andexternal policy priorities."" Commenting on the Paris currency accord, Gleske said itschances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on currentinterest rate differentials being maintained. These chances ""seem to me to rest critically on theexpectation that the current configuration of interest rates,and the monetary policies behind them, will assure smoothfinancing of current account imbalances in the months ahead."" Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments hadlearned ""that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thustend to overshoot."" He said this ""would seem to be unnecessaryand should be avoided if at all possible."" Monetary policies can help achieve this, but only ifmarkets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies willlead to balanced international payments, he said. "
1,"World Bank President Barber Conable isexpected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largestdebtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes totackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said. Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, willmeet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers. He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia'slargest nation was being managed well, but the slump in worldoil prices called for major policy adjustments. Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projectsin the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populousisland. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detaileddiscussions with ministers tomorrow. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severelyhit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil andgas revenues in half. Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed toprovide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesiapay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects. Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded tothe oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans tobridge its deficit. Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suhartoand leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policychange, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-costprotected economy. ""Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all callfor major policy adjustments and external support,"" Conable saidin his arrival statement. But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections nextmonth, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply thatthe Bank is demanding specific changes. ""We believe there has been wise leadership here and theeconomy is being very well managed,"" Conable told reporters atJakarta airport. Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it theThird World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968. Conable did not spell out what further changes he wouldlike to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changesalready introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more. Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support,the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of thegovernment's trade reform measures, and supported itsdetermination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth. Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since lastMay to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourageoutside investment. Suharto has also ordered a government committee to lookinto which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could besold. But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said thegovernment appeared divided over how far to take its reforms. Western analysts say that in particular the government isunsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-costmonopolies, which control core areas of the economy. Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week thatIndonesia faced very limited economic choices. It could not spend its way out of trouble because thiswould increase the balance of payments deficit and domesticinflation.  He said the main objective was to raise exports outsidethe oil and natural gas sector. Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by thegovernment to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financialyear which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in1986/87. "

7,"Brazilian Finance MinisterDilson Funaro said his country's foreign debt crisis could onlybe solved by changes in the international financial system. Speaking to a business conference he said ""It is not Brazilthat has to make adjustments with the IMF (InternationalMonetary Fund). It is the international financial communitythat is taking away resources from the developing countries."" ""The crisis is not in Brazil, a country that has had thethird biggest trade surplus ...In the past two years Brazil hadremitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received onlytwo billion in fresh funds,"" he added. Funaro said that during his recent trip to the U.S., Europeand Japan to explain Brazil's decision last month to suspendinterest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt, hestressed the country's commitment to growth. ""We need to and will make the effort (to solve the debtproblem) but we cannot make an effort that means we stopgrowing,"" he said, adding that political and not purelycommercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis. Brazil, whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largestin the developing world, has been under pressure from officialand private creditors to work out an economic adjustmentprogram with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreignpayments problems. President Jose Sarney's government has repeatedly refusedto approach the Fund, arguing that an IMF programme would leadto recession. Funaro said that in his talks with creditors hehad tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope offinding a lasting solution to the debt problem. ""We are negotiating so that the debt question should not beone of continuous crisis.""

7,"Britain and West Germany told theirEuropean Community partners they would strongly oppose majorelements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses. At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for afull debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that hasalready angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-ledprotests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said. West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, willadvise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenanceother proposals that could hit German farmers, they added. They said West Germany's objections were put in a letterthis weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, thepresident of the EC's Executive Commission which had putforward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new ECcash crisis. Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cerealsproduction curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for aproposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) -a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level outforeign exchange fluctuations for farm exports. Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit Germanfarmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult toexport to weaker currency states, which means virtually allother 11 EC states, diplomats said. Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to imposea hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because itcould seriously damage EC trade relations. The diplomats said the United States had been the mostoutspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing itas a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade bodyGATT. But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC,such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina,Iceland and Norway, they added. Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farmreform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures thatcould spark a damaging trade war with the U.S. Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision oneither the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today,diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear thatneither has a chance of surviving when it comes up forsubstantive consideration by EC farm ministers later thismonth, they added. "

1,"The oil services industry is on theverge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oilindustry analysts said. The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on somestocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in thesecond half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in thefirst half, and continue into the next decade.  ""People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to goup to start buying,"" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior researchanalyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc. Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>,Halliburton Co &lt;HAL>, Dresser Industries &lt;DI>, BakerInternational &lt;BKO>, and McDermott International Inc &lt;MDR>,which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, aDallas-based investor. Analysts said although major oil companies are increasingexploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup inoil services will begin in the U.S. ""Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move upfaster,"" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs. The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co&lt;HT> figures show. The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 isprojected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge,vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. ""Thefirst significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in thesecond half of 1988,"" Kerridge said. Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similarpattern, Kerridge said. ""Halliburton is the best value,"" said Jeffrey Freedman,vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, addingthe company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of commonstock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess,and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cashflow including debt. Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil servicestock. ""Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominanttechnical leader in the industry,"" Freedman said. ""Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring,including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and itsconsiderable cash horde sets the stage for the company tomaximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize onthe project upturn in exploration and development activity,""according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president atRobert W.

0,"American Express Co's plan to sell astake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be aprelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,analysts said. American Express earlier said it has a generalunderstanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs. The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,as investors speculated on the possibility of more investmentin the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns. The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response tothe relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents aprice of 2.7 times book value. Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insidertrading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8times book value. American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. Forthe last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors ofa spinoff of part of Shearson. Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit willbenefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasinglyimportant Tokyo financial markets. ""I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step,"" saidLong. ""What you will see probably in the future is AmericanExpress selling an additional 17 pct in the public market andhave a public vehicle for Shearson,"" Long said. ""Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitmentinto an illiquid situation,"" he said of Nippon. Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake inShearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, likeother investment banks, needs capital to expand globally. American express has said the total employees of shearsonwill expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, thatnumber is substantially lower than growth last year, a companyspokesman said. American Express officials would not comment beyond astatement made this morning. That statement, however, did notclose off the possibility of a public offering or other optionfor Shearson. David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possibleShearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believesthe firm will digest the Nippon investment first. ""I think they'll figure out what they're going to do withthe money they have,"" he said. Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also saidAmerican Express could determine to sell shares to the public. In its statement, the financial services giant said it iscontinuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition tothe investment by Nippon. American Express said options under study range fromexpanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competitionto broadening its access to capital. American Express also said the options reflect thecontinuing integral role of Shearson in American Express'worldwide financial services strategy. Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding aJapanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake toSumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion. Analysts speculated there will be more such matches. ""Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. Theydon't have the money. There's just not enough internal capitalgrowth,"" said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows otherU.S. brokerage companies. Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, areinterested in the expertise of American brokers.

""The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easyas OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort outthe problems,"" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates, CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPECfaces is excess oil supply in world oil markets. ""OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a productionissue and must be addressed in that way,"" said Paul Mlotok, oilanalyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and itsability to keep production under control have given way to apessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon ifit wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even anemergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC productionabove the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December. ""OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot havedeemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,"" said theregional manager for one of the major oil companies who spokeon condition that he not be named. ""The market is now trying toteach them that lesson again,"" he added. David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPECto meet before June, although not immediately. However, he isnot optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems. ""They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of thewinter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and Aprilwhen demand slackens,"" Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything morethan reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."" Analysts said that the next two months will be critical forOPEC's ability to hold together prices and output. ""OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weekssince buyers will come back into the market then,"" said DillardSpriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energyand Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oilhas been rising through the first quarter and this may haveprompted excesses in its production. ""Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpdand is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what weare seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting thisdemand through current production,"" he told "

4,"Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain'sdecision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savingsbanks, saying it reflected the socialist government'sdetermination not to ease up in the fight against inflationdespite the painful social effects of four years of austerity. The central bank last night raised the requirement by onepercentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excessliquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets. Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by theBank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates tochoke off money supply growth. ""I think it's a good measure,"" a senior foreign banker said.""It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest ratesand avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy."" ""It shows that the political will is very strong. They knowthat controlling inflation will make industry more competitiveand bring down unemployment in the long run,"" he added. The head of another foreign bank said that only a monthago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a risein reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy ofraising interest rates. But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting moneyfrom abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanishexports less competitive. The government says industry's competitiveness is alsobeing hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate wasway above that of Spain's major trading partners in theEuropean Community, which it joined a year ago. To help meet this year's target of five pct, it isinsisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage forclashes with trade unions, who say they have made enoughsacrifices. Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whosedemands essentially involve more government spending, havebecome an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister FelipeGonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can. Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could havesome impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit themoney market too hard. The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its keyovernight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged attoday's auction. The rate has been increased nine times sincethe start of the year, when it was below 12 pct. Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise inany case with the end of the six pct maximium interest ratebanks can offer for time deposits of up to six months. The measure will take effect tomorrow, following thepublication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankerssay the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,inevitably, push lending rates higher. A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds whichbanks must invest in specific areas, also takes effecttomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last monththat it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higherinterest rates. "

Some companies would be sold in their entirety and otherswould be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino,president of the government's state company holding firm, thenational development council (conade).  He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was toslim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billionintis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy allor part of the companies.

4,"U.K. Interest rates look set to movelower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension ofa British National Savings issue yesterday. The Department of National Savings, effectively a TreasuryDepartment unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launchedin October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-yearprivate investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman saidthe suspension was just a reaction to yields on nationalsavings bonds being way out of line with the rest of themarket. The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutestoday of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, thesecond such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted. They said the near-instant sale of the entire new giltsissue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pctdownpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rateshad to drop sooner rather than later. The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downwardpressure on money market rates remained intact, with thebellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at10-9-7/8 pct.  It coincided with another strong sterling rally whichpushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar. ""That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed,"" saidStephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokersPhillips and Drew; ""It is an indication that the market believesrates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-pointimmediately after the budget (on March 17), and some peoplehope for more."" Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by theNational Savings Department was ""of considerable significance."" It said, ""the real message ... Is that the decks are beingquickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by thebuilding societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cutin bank base rates to 10 pct materialises."" Building societies have said a drop in bank base rateswould normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to areduction in mortgage lending rates. Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed theNational Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasurypolicy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut. ""National Savings has been competing too effectively withthe building societies of late. Building society income hasbeen depressed in recent months,"" he said. He and other analysts said Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lidon U.K. Inflation. Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britainthan in most other Western economies with inflation seen risingwell above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 afterlast year's 3.7 pct. Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumerprices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rateswould reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct. But Lewis and others noted that building societies had beencomplaining to the government about intense competition fromNational Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for earlymortgage rate cuts. ""The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBRfunding from National Savings, but he must be taking thebuilding societies' criticism to heart. It looks like theNational Savings move reflects this,"" one senior dealer said. A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on thisinterpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely areaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which hadpushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line withthe rest of the market. ""We are not politically motivated ... Funding was justbecoming too expensive and we don't need all that money,"" hetold "

0,"Automobile dealerships have becomelarge, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year. Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers andbuyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that thelargest are considering offering shares to the public, analystssay. Retail car sales ""are at a point of transition. There's notmuch that's off the table in terms of creative thinking"" aboutways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the Universityof Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. The retail car market is ""much more freeform now"" than itwas in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroitanalyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates. Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.Dealerships sold one kind of car--a ""Chevy"" or a Ford or aStudebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the NationalAutomobile Dealers Association. That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's VolkswagenBeatle--began to gain popularity. The ""Bug"" caused ""arebellion"" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom fromrestrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,says Jauppi. One of the most visible changes in retail car sales hasbeen in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-foldincrease from 1956--and employed 34 workers. ""I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mlndlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,""says Cole. ""There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than thatmake cars,"" he says. With the increase in size, large dealers have been buyingup other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trendwill let up. Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800principal owners today. Many dealers are experimenting with owning severalfranchises, some of which might compete against each other. ""Itused to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now aChevrolet dealer might handle several lines,"" Jauppi says. As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking aboutthe possibility that some of them might become publicly-ownedor open international operations. Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,""are obviously thinking of very seriously,"" says Cole. Although some say the franchise system might get in the wayof a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles totrading in car dealer shares. ""Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thingthe manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells thosecars. It could happen any time,"" Jauppi says. ""If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at thescale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard toresist taking them public,"" said another analyst. And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to becomeinternational. ""We're going to have international dealers--dealer networksthat are worldwide,"" he says. U.S. dealers will be attractedparticularly to Europe, where the market will expand fasterthan the U.S., he says. ""It's not totally off the wall,"" says Cole. "
7,"U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for ashowdown between protectionists and free traders as a majortrade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by thefull House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a keyHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned down version oflegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices. This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional effortsto restore competitiveness of American industries and turnaround last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made toomany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to backamendments to ""get tough"" with countries that violate tradeagreements or keep out U.S. products.  On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegianceto free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much intrade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiatingpowers. Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee'sbill was not one ""that a free trader like me could endorse inall respects,"" but he emphasized there was a consensus amongtrade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicanswould ultimately endorse. Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, ""to make ourtrade policy stronger without violating our international tradeagreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have notdone the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven'tavoided violating agreements."" In a key concession made at the urging of the powerfulchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the tradesubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forcedReagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on importsfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it wouldhurt the U.S. economy. Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an IllinoisDemocrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary ifthe House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law. Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of atough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and thisyear only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when hesaw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill. As an indication of his success, White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration stilldid not like some provisions. But he added, ""Generally we feelvery good about the bipartisan consideration of the tradelegislation. I think we are progressing very well."" The first battle will take place next week when the fullHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries suchas Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluseswith the United States. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide onlythat the existence of a large trade surplus with the UnitedStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,but would not automatically set off retaliation. Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch freetrader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief fromimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered theadministration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan wouldsign would not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in astatement, ""I'm not trying to write legislation to please LaneKirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signedby the president."" In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls fortrade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to holdoff his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protectthe domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reaganvetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of themost influential proponents of aid for specific industriesbeset by low priced foreign competition. Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for thedomestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senateplan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when importsreach half of domestic consumption. For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S.enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administrationto act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such asdumping products in the United States at prices below the costof production. It also forces the administration to act rapidly when anindustry complains that a surge in imports threatens itsexistence. Congressmen said the change would have required theU.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on carimports in 1981. "

7,"West Germany's current accountsurplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in Februaryfrom a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, aspokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said. The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added. The Statistics Office had originally put the Januarycurrent account surplus at 4.9 billion marks. The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billionmark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the currentaccount surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplusrecorded in February 1986. A Statistics Office statement said the widening of theFebruary current account surplus compared with January was dueto seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current accountfigures are seasonally adjusted. February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986but a rise of 5.5 pct against January. Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pctcompared with January. The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculatethe real change in exports and imports in February. But forcomparison purposes it noted that in January the average valueof imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the averagevalue of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct. Within the current account, the services account had 300mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln marksurplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion markdeficit. Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports invalue terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with ayear earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986. The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks forJanuary/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1billion marks in the year-ago period. The cumulative current account surplus for January andFebruary 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billionmarks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said. Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplusreflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well asseasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlierthis week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct againstJanuary while export prices were unchanged. ""The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trendthat is not expected to change for several months at least,""said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said thesurplus could fall to around 80 billion marks. An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) inFrankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave amore accurate picture of West Germany's trade position. He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January andFebruary together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplusposted in November and December. ""The trend is clearly lower,"" he said. This economist, who declined to be named, said the Februaryrise was also partly explained by special factors in January,when there had been a number of public holidays as well asextremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.

5,"""Endaka,"" the strong yen, has usurped""Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster"" as Japan's favourite horrorstory. The yen's 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last twoyears has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon,the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15,000 dlrsa month. But ""endaka,"" like many Japanese products, is for foreignconsumption, locals and long-time foreign residents said. ""It's not really that expensive. I don't pay attention tothe cost of living,"" said Cheryl Richmond, a 25-year-oldCanadian teacher of English in Tokyo. Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by ""chatting"" 40hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn thelanguage. For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny, quiettwo-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, one ofTokyo's prime business and entertainment districts, and hasmanaged to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month. She spends less than 6.50 dlrs a day on food despite eatingout once a day. ""For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comeswith soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet, pickles, misosoup, rice and tea,"" although she takes only coffee forbreakfast and a sandwich for dinner. No one argues that Tokyo is cheap, but long-time residentssee no need to spend the 2,000 to 15,000 dlrs a month spent byforeign firms to house executives in Western-style homes. The companies feel otherwise. They say they must pay theprice to bring over the best people needed to back up theirpush into Japan's increasingly lucrative markets. ""You can't expect people to move from New York or Sydney andtrade down. It's not reasonable,"" said a spokesman forInternational Business Machines Corp (IBM), which supportsWestern lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo. Tokyo is the world's most expensive city for businesstravellers, a survey issued this month by Employment ConditionsAbroad said. It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend onaverage more than 300 dlrs a day. While the businessmen have little choice but to come here,many tourists, especially those from Europe, are opting tovisit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia. The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates ""endaka"" caused an 11.5pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year. Those who came tried to cut back on expenses, chiefly bycurtailing shopping, it said. To help combat ""endaka"" and the slump in tourism, the TouristBureau prepared a pamphlet, ""Economical Travel in Japan."" It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-pricedbusiness hotels and Japanese-style inns, cheap sushi and publicbaths while getting a ""revealing glimpse of Japanese in theirdaily lives."" Residents of Okubo House, a transit hotel in Tokyo'sShin-Okubo love hotel district, offer even more savvy advice.

1,"The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drillinglast year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gasbubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies nextwinter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analystssaid. Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity thatis difficult and costly to import in large quantities, couldmore than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by1990, some analysts said. The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilitiesand big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence ofactivity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some ofthe nation's largest gas reserves are located. ""We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent,"" saidJames Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. ""Manycompanies appear to be switching from oil to gas drillingbecause they're betting that the gas market will be back inbalance in a year or two."" The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome newsfor drilling and oilfield service companies that barelysurvived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs abarrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oilprices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur areturn to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rigcount soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfieldroustabouts commanded premium wages. The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> rig count, abarometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigsactive in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year. In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 butdived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oilprices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times. Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said ""In 1986, the UnitedStates replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and thatreplacement rate won't be any better this year."" He added, ""We don't have the options we do with oil.Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity andimporting liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasiblein the next 10 years because of the cost."" Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserveswere discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates. George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Coagreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for anew cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling. ""We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need todedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no laterthan mid-1988,"" Gaspar said. Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging thatcould last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig countto peak near 2,000 in December of 1989. Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to beconducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, wherefederal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to thegovernment unless drilling begins in the next two or threeyears. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as ExxonCorp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum havealready indicated plans to increase spending for drilling laterthis year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said. For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD> subsidiary, willspend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepestproduction platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet ofgas per day. But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas andKansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership &lt;MLP> inrecent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry ison the verge of a recovery. Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do. ""The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil getsabove 30 dlrs a barrel,"" said Pickens, 58, adding he did notexpect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime. Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists. Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expectsignificant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990swhen the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to aboutseven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about threedlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said. "

7,"The U.S. economy is showing somepromising signs of accelerated expansion despite thesluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, privateeconomists say. Some of the slowness experienced in the October-Decemberperiod had been expected to spill over into the first quarterthis year, as the tax law changes that went into effect inJanuary slowed business and consumer spending. But some of the latest economic data show signs ofsurprising strength in the U.S. economy, although someeconomists remain cautious about the outlook. The Commerce Department reported today that new orders fordurable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pctrise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defensegoods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agencysaid. The February numbers surpassed the expectations of manyfinancial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat toincreases of up to five pct. The January/February employment statistics suggest theGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth forthe first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, aneconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farmjobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain inJanuary and a 225,000 December increase, the government said. The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate ofabout three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley. Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuildingtheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in thesecond quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in thesecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumptionand government spending. He also sees residential constructiondeclining mostly for multi-family housing units. Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of thefourth quarter slowness will continue. Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in thefirst quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter andshow a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter. The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in theU.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline inthe dollar's value over the last year and half. ""The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,"" Levypredicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but atleast one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as theprices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas. The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,which soared to record levels last year, will improve this yearand the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for theyear compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year. As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate theirdomestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others. U.S. officials believe that would help take some of thepressure off the United States whose five years of economicgrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries. The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market fortheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed toservice their foreign debt. The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at amodest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter. There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalancebetween the volume of goods imported to the United States andthose shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume ofexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the factthat in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsenedduring the closing three months of 1986. While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporateprofits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, thegovernment said. It also reported that inflation, as measuredby the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing amoderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years. The government also reported that consumer spending, a keyelement of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct inFebruary, after falling two pct in January. The Federal Reserve Board also reported that themanufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elementsof the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery. In its latest report on current economic conditions, theFed said that economic activity in the various regions of thecountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving.Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in mostregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish. Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said thepick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to thedrop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a majorpick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economywill slip into recession either. He said higher prices on imported products and wage cutsthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeezeconsumers purchasing power. ""That pattern is starting and will continue for a number ofyears,"" Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering arounda modest two pct level for the next few years. "

An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish afunding limit. The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell throughearlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposedJustice Department consent decree that would have given thecompanies only three months to find a buyer for the Reedbusiness.

Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct ofHughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revisedterms of the agreement give the companies six months to find abuyer for the Reed drilling bit business.

2,"Schweizerische Aluminimum AG &lt;ALUZ.Z>(Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansingits balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said. ""The threshold of profitability has returned to theforeseeable future,"" he said. ""We expect already in 1987approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, thatour industrial environment does not worsen."" He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of pastlosses. Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985. Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion andnet turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion. Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for1985. But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a newsconference the new management installed a year ago had decidedto restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminaterights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as anasset. Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took angross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from472 mln in 1985. It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining,after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiaryin the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in1985. Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves andexceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22. Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this ""radicalelimination of the mortgages of the past"" painful, but said thefoundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy. Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity wasstrong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion. Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pctin 1985. In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse hadarranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank ofSwitzerland &lt;SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp &lt;SBVZ.Z> and CreditSuisse &lt;CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into asubordinated loan. The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and notcash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used onlyto a small extent, and the parent company had been granted anew credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swissbanks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987. Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintainingbauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts. That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc lossinstead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a479 mln loss instead of 179 mln. The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similaralternations were made for previous years.

6,"Uganda's state-run Coffee MarketingBoard (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past twomonths due to a bottleneck in export shipments andadministrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said. The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (theequivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers andprocessors for coffee already delivered, but its present exportrevenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said. The board's cash crisis has serious implications for theeconomy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct ofUganda's total exports. The CMB's financial difficulties first started in Januaryfollowing delays in rail-freighting export consignments ofcoffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga. These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons inUganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandanwagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan andTanzanian railway systems, the sources said Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publiclyacknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears tolocal suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport formoving exports. Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeezewould be resolved in two weeks. However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies betweenthe Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it outof action between February 21 and March 15, causing freshdelays in cargo movements. Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruptionof rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has bannedtheir haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs. Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMBwas holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags. These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda'sexpected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September)crop, the sources said. According to the sources, the board's financial problemshave been aggravated by long delays in processing exportreceipts. The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycleexport receipts into payments to local producers, whereasexport bills handled by local banks took half that time toprocess, they said. The sources said the CMB's price structure had beenovertaken by Uganda's high inflation rate, unofficiallyestimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a furtherdisincentive to producers, already owed large arrears. ""The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three monthsbehind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and thesooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, thebetter for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole,"" oneof the sources said. The government is currently negotiating a package ofeconomic reforms with the World Bank and International MonetaryFund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid tohelp Uganda's economic recovery after 15 years of politicalstrife.

1,"Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the countryrecover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said. But the French bank's plan, which would effectivelypostpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for severalmonths, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52members of the loan syndicate. The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports wasruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five monthsto repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair. President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated totaldamages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said thatEcuador as a result would maintain January's suspension ofinterest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt. Payments were halted in January because of the drop in theprice of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador'sexport earnings and 60 pct of government revenue. Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in theParibas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a jobfor international financial organizations and not forcommercial banks, bankers said. The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed lastOctober 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for aLatin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted inAugust 1982. Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel stronglythat the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, theyfear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditionsfor Latin borrowers will be set back. ""There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feelit's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of arestructuring would look bad,"" one banker commented. "
3,"The European Community, EC, sold75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuingbid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S.Agriculture Department said. The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs pertonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latestreport on Export Markets for U.S grains. EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes inthe 1985/86 season, it said. The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at atime when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheatimport market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the currentforecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year. The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline indomestic production, and says government plans to lower theguaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrswill contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said. It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier ofthe additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase ofU.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

1,"World governmentsshould prepare for an inevitable significant increase in theprice of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp&lt;XON> director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said. Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulkof world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in aspeech prepared for delivery to the Australian PetroleumExploration Association (APEA) annual conference. It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewherewill not change this fact, he said. McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields containabout 35 pct of all oil ever discovered. Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside theMiddle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in thelast 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said. He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at therate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year. More than half of remaining proved reserves are in theMiddle East, he said. McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oiloutside the Middle East because each addition contributes to adiversity of supply desirable for global political and economicstability. ""It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-countrydiscoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stabletaxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up ofacreage for exploration,"" he said. Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost theincentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources ofpetroleum, he added. "

""Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, anda solid capital position...combined with the restraint ofnon-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in theperiods ahead,"" chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement. The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarterended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a yearago. Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue tosubstantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank'sinternational operations remains weak, reflectingresource-related difficulties of private and public sectorborrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital marketactivities. The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago whileearnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrsfrom 42 mln dlrs last year. Royal Bank said first quarter international net interestincome declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenuesfrom international investment banking as well as a significantloss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago. Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs lastyear. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retaildeposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue butlower securities commissions from international investment bankoperations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said. The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth inconsumer lending, particularly residential mortgages. "

His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exemptstripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each dayfrom the state's 4.6 pct severance tax.

0,"Chrysler Corp's 1.5 billion dlr bid totakeover American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> should help bolster thesmall automaker's sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000employees in doubt, industry analysts say. It was ""business as usual"" yesterday at the American Motorsheadquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled byChrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, according to companyspokesman Edd Snyder. But AMC's future, to be discussed at a board meeting today,would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than ifit had continued with the state-run French car group as itscontrolling shareholder. Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assemblyplant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant wouldbe in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North Americanauto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass. Both plants are far from ""state of the art"" for carmanufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor laborrelations at each. ""Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants,"" said MichaelLuckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm ShearsonLehman Brothers. ""They probably will close the Toledo plant andmove Jeep production to Canada."" Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at thevery least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able towring concessions from the United Automobile Workers unionlocal representing Jeep workers. ""The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as theyhave AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will haveunderutilized facilities to transfer production,"" he said. Analysts said they foresaw no major complications thatwould abort a combination which historians said would be theauto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formedin 1954. AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its lossesof more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in Francefor Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it couldnot forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at theearliest. In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman LeeIacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mlndlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of1,200 dealers as the major attractions. Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventuallyto sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overheadcosts in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incurin the AMC buyout.

0,"Corporate raider Carl Icahnacknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigationby the Securities and Exchange Commission into possibleviolations of securities laws. Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc&lt;TWA>, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required tomake with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group. The SEC issued a formal order launching the privateinvestigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing. The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find outwhether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities lawsand related rules, Icahn said. Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition andsubsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certainunspecified companies, he said. Federal law requires individuals or groups of individualswho have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes incompanies of at least five pct within 10 days. Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed inconnection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he hasdisclosed that he is among those being investigated. By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which isobviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was alsoalerting current and potential shareholders of TWA. It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that theyor their officers are the targets of government probes toacknowledge the existence of the otherwise secretinvestigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirementsto their shareholders. Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and otherswhom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring andselling more than five pct of a company's stock. SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securitieslaw violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probeinto the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according topublished reports. Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amountof stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or makingno filing at all could indicate a scheme to ""warehouse"" sharesof stock. In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting inconcert would each amass stock in the company withoutdisclosing that they have an agreement among them. By failing to disclose that they are acting together themarket is unware of the amount of stock of a company that iscontrolled by a group acting in concert. Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzbergfamily of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme whileit was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc. "

0,"Companies will henceforth be able to ownstakes in banks, but these should not constitute a ""dominant""holding, an Italian government committee ruled. The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings,headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decisionreflected the ""need to safeguard the principle of separationbetween banks and non-financial concerns."" It did not quantify what might constitute a ""dominant""holding. The committee also set conditions for the allocation ofcredits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes inthem, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italycould exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes heldby banks in companies or other banks. Under the ruling, credits given by banks or theirsubsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or moreof the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits. The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifthof the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself ortwo-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by thegroup or individual concerned. Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concernsin which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreignbanks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks tosubsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also beexcluded from the conditions. The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules intheir statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holdingfive pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privilegedtreatment with regard to credit allocation and terms. With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank ofItaly can exercise supervisory controls when information on abank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in acompany or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly orindirectly. Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake heldis below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest. The controls will not be exercised in cases where the valueof the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of twopredefined limits. These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of thetotal assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank. "

2,"Problems in the farmbelt andoilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overallincome for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal DepositInsurance Corp (FDIC) said. The nation's 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985's record 18.1billion dlrs. The total was still the second highest ever reported, butit was the first time income had not grown since 1961. The figures reflected a radical split in the health ofbanks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said. In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, whileone in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses. Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDICsaid in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profilesit planned to issue. ""I don't remember a time when there was such a cleardistinction by geographic area,"" FDIC Chairman William Seidmantold reporters. He said that while the figures were not good, they showedthe problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole butwith regional differences in economic performance. Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as manyas failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubtedthe pace would continue.  On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in thenumber of new problem banks in all regions except theSouthwest, Seidman said. Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourthquarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from ayear ago. Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs ormore -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDICsaid. Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil'smoratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks. He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedomto run their banks and that an increase in failures was to beexpected. But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meantother banks that were better managed have gotten stronger,Seidman said. "

7,"Japanese microchip makers are beingstrong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact onsemiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan'smarket to foreign chips, industry analysts said. But doubts remain over whether the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuringthe firms, can successfully battle market forces and whetherthe U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of anybreathing space, they said. U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last Septemberhave pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanesechipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said. ""MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industryto get things done,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) associatevice president Peter Wolffe. Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for theJanuary to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensivechips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subjectto the pact's price controls. The ministry also asked electronics firms to providedistributors with certificates designating them as authorisedexporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which greymarketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said. U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was injeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American marketsand little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan. But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to theproduction cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corpsaid it would cut production in line with MITI's request. ""NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI'sdemands,"" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. ""OnceNEC cuts production, it means they all have."" Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanesefirms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales thatthe Commerce Department assigns them under the pact. ""The best way to lower cost is to produce more,"" said SalomonBrothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec. Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could alsospur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst MattAizawa said. Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any newrestrictions, some industry officials said. ""It's like tax avoidance schemes,"" said Steve Donovan, headof MMI Japan K.K. ""As soon as you close one route, anotheropens."" MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earliershrugged off MITI guidance. ""It's getting to be like communism,"" said one. But analysts said output cuts could help by making iteasier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcingfirms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss. ""They're going to have to start running their businesseslike businesses,"" Bache's Wolffe said. MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaignurging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industryofficials said response has been mixed at best. ""There has been some change, but it's not across the board,""said one U.S. Spokesman. ""The companies have a varying degree ofurgency."" The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on thetroubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added. Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamicrandom access memory) chips could merely speed the transitionto one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said. Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memorychips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, theysaid. Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing themost advanced technology for microchip manufacturing. Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said. ""The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn'teven have an office here,"" a source close to the industry said.""You could question just how committed they are."" In addition, some industry analysts question theeffectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out thirdcountry chipmakers such as those in South Korea. ""(South) Korea's gaining market share,"" said one analyst.""They're the real winners from the agreement."" "

""There are unquestionably other buyers out there,"" addedKidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. ""A lot of companies havelooked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it."" Among the companies that would be interested in bidding forFairchild are Advanced Micro Devices &lt;AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif.,and LSI Logic Corp &lt;LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analystssaid. Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp &lt;NSM>,Texas Instruments Inc &lt;TXN> and Motorola Inc &lt;MOT> might alsoseek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrustproblems, the analysts added. Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to beconsidering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino,Calif., company, analysts said. In a brief statement announcing the termination of theagreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision openedup other possibilities, including a possible buyout byFairchild management. The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu wouldhave bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,because rising opposition to the deal by the Reaganadministration made it unlikely that the sale could becompleted within a reasonable period of time. Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing thatthe companies did not need government approval to complete thetransaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-ownedcompanies. ""Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal becausethe U.S. government didn't want it,"" said Johnson of L.F.Rothschild. A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on thecompany's news release. He said only that the company was reviewing a number ofpossible alternatives for the Fairchild unit. Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediatelyavailable for comment. Analysts noted the significance of the government'sapparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control ofFairchild. Administration officials, including Commerce SecretaryMalcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese controlof key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and militaryweapons systems. ""The government really stood up for the semiconductorindustry,"" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. ""That, I think, isthe real significance of this."" Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government mightnow feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints aboutJapanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor tradeagreement signed last summer.

4,"After an already steep fall in the pastweek, U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declinesin the near term, financial analysts said. However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bondfutures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and thecontracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery beforeresuming their decline. Key to the near-term direction of futures will be thecourse of the dollar, they said. ""As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,"" said DeanWitter analyst Karen Gibbs. The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year lowagainst the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday whenseveral large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised theirprime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct. ""Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar,foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar declineis over,"" Gibbs said. The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debtfutures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation. Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at themeeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making arm, the FederalOpen Market Committee, this week, analysts said. ""To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, asteepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices looksuspiciously like the traces of expectations of acceleratinginflation,"" said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEnteeand McGinley Inc. Such expectations could mean that ""a shift in policy towardrestriction of bank reserves is likely to get very seriousconsideration,"" at the FOMC meeting, he said. Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highlyvisible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said. Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found inseasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, hesaid. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mlndlrs over the past several months, he said. In the meantime, however, ""the market looks a bitoversold,"" said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures. Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition coulddrive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to testchart support near the recent low of 97-13/32. Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Bostonsaid that the key test for June bonds will be whether thenearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32. ""All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped andbuyers have surfaced at that level,"" Keefe said. If that level is broken, and the dollar continues todecline, Keefe said she expects the June bond contract todecline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrendline dating back to 1984. "

""The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S.Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as theAmerican situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise,"" hesaid. To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said. He rejected recent calls from some government quarters forwage increases this year as a means of raising privateconsumption and thus boosting domestic demand. ""We have to keep wages as low as possible,"" he said. He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressingthe outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in additionto hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic marketmanufacturers through cheap imports. Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsukisaid. Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and adownturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect serviceindustries, he said. It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fullyemploy those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, hesaid. Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall inthe business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possiblerecession in the Japanese economy, he said. Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyondlevels experienced in 1986. The government's Economic Planning Agency said last weekthe economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performancesince 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oilprice crisis.

7,"Top U.S. and European farm trade andgovernment representatives called for a sweeping reform ofworld agriculture to redress a critical demand and supplyimbalance. Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets heredemonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need foran urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade andproduction. ""It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom andharmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) thedisruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls ofprotection climb higher and the level of possible retaliationbecome more harmful,"" U.S. Department of Agriculture DeputyAdministrator William Bailey said. Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, whichends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need toadjust its policies to the changing market environment. The need for urgent reforms is justified by the ""imbalanceand tensions of the world economy,"" the secretary general of theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and DevelopmentJean-Claude Paye said. And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, he noted. Paye stressed the need for a progressive and jointreduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measuresto help farmers in unprofitable areas. Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farmprices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, andinstead help farmers through income support and adjustmentaids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president ofCargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses. Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must takegreater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices. However, ""differentiated policy treatment is required"" totake account of large disparities in the situation around theEC, he said. ""Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economyand will remain so if the right policy is pursued within theCommunity,"" he said. "

Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference theSaudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose suchconditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment ofits commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oilconsumption in Brazil. But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds anddecide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobraswill lift the order to cancel the shipment. Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms byMonday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere. ""Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be muchbetter for us, because with the market prices more or less thesame, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage,"" he said. Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importingBrazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothingfrom Brazil, he said.

7,"U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for ashowdown between protectionists and free traders as a majortrade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by thefull House of Representatives in late April. In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a keyHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version oflegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices. The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional effortsto restore competitiveness of American industries and turnaround last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcementof trade laws. The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly oncomplaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping productsin the United States at prices below cost of production. Italso forces the administration to act rapidly when an industrycomplains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls fortrade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made toomany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to backamendments to ""get tough"" with countries that violate tradeagreements or keep out U.S. products. But congressmen known for their allegiance to free tradesaid the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputesand they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was notone ""that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,""but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to worktoward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. The goal of trade legislation was ""to make our trade policystronger without violating our international trade agreements,""he said. In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and MeansCommittee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the tradesubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forcedReagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on importsfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation ifit would hurt the U.S. economy. Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach wasnecessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would signinto law. Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a toughHouse trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year heonly reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he sawDemocratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters latelast week that the administration still did not like some ofthe bill's provisions, but he added, ""Generally we feel verygood about the bipartisan consideration of the tradelegislation. I think we are progressing very well."" The first battle will take place next week when the fullHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, SouthKorea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide onlythat the existence of a large trade surplus with the UnitedStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,but would not automatically set off retaliation. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief fromimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered theadministration when he said any trade bill Reagan would signwould not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate bysaying, ""I'm not trying to write legislation to please LaneKirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signedby the president."" Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a billto protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aidesaid. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the mostinfluential proponents of aid for specific industries beset bylow-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call forimport relief for the domestic oil industry and announced hissupport for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil importtariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.

President Robert Staubli told a news conference that thefirst two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit wouldat least equal last year's figure, but said much depended onoutside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate. The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss onSwissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of27 mln francs the previous year, he said. The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francsin 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended onthe speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.

Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mlnfrancs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45mln francs supplementary depreciation. Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions madethis time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange ratefluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc. While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop inthe dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuelprices, there was no such offset for the strength of the francagainst other European currencies. ""Income and profit generated by services to these countriesshrank by a very substantial margin,"" he said. ""Exchange ratetrends therefore hit us much more severely than most otherairlines."" "

The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid tosubsidise export credits in so-called ""mixed credits,"" the OECDsaid. The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July thisyear and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixedcredits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct forcredits covering exports to the world's least developednations. Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculatingthe aid element in mixed credits, to take account of differentinterest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,which hosted the reform negotiations, said. Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised tradeloans have also been revised with the aim of cutting thesubsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relativelyrich developing countries by July next year. The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. Tostop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aidto subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage. OECD officials said the agreement was based on aprovisional accord reached in January subject to ratificationby member governments. Some governments, including Austria, hadlinked their final approval to other trade credit issues whichwould be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.

2,"Mellon Bank Corp said it expectsto report a loss for the first quarter in the range of 55 mlnto 65 mln dlrs or 2.13 to 2.15 dlrs a share. The company also said it intends to reduce its secondquarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts. Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in thefirst quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs incharge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-lossreserve. It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cashbasis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs. In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrsor 2.13 dlrs a share. Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs andincreased provisions address four areas of concern in thebank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector,developing countries, some basic industrial companies andseveral commercial real estate businesses. Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the firstquarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct ofthe loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct oftotal loans at the end of 1986. Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of thefirst quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines. Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986. Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement inenergy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lackof a substantial recovery in energy prices this year,especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent toincrease reserves and take losses on loans in this sector. ""This action relates both to loans to companies directlyinvolved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers,home builders and financial institutions in the SouthwesternUnited States,"" Barnes said. As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mlndlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but hadcharged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt. He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quitBrazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term creditlines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil andother sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts. Loans to basic industries were not major contributors tothe increase in non-performing assets or to first-quartercharge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about theabsence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries. The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continuedmanagement cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon hasthe financial strength to deal with current uncertainties,Barnes said. ""We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presentlytrouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing themaggressively,"" he added. "

7,"Japan today announced another mammothmonthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure tointensify already mounting pressure on the country for action. ""The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for notmoving more quickly,"" Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economistEric Rasmussen said. The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplussoared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion inJanuary and 4.77 billion a year ago. The current account surplus, which includes trade inservices as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs lastmonth from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago. After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figureslook a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the tradesurplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs froma record 9.58 billion in January. ""In the medium term we expect this modest improvement tocontinue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward offfurther protectionism or further yen strength,"" said WilliamStirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive onworld markets while making imports into the country cheaper. ""On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making someprogress on getting exports down,"" Jardine's Rasmussen said. But imports do not seem to be picking up much because theJapanese economy remains sluggish, he said. Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slowerimport growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners workedoff stocks they had built up in January. The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume ofexports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increasein January. This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yenagainst the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impacton exports, they said. But economists warned that may not be soon enough forJapan's trading partners. "

The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a jointstatement. The previously announced float of part of its Delhiinterest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement. Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, whichholds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-ledCooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects. In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equallyin any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensateprices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi'sinterests in the next two years, the statement said. ""The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest willbe more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with thefloat,"" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement. Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focusefforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and buildingmaterials in which CSR has had long and successful managementexperience and strong market leadership. With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businessesmore aggressively and earlier, he said. As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhisale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;PioneerSugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing itsentire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs. After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin isAustralia's largest oil and gas producing area with currentgross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gasliquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubicfeet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said. The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The BrokenHill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait, its first onshoreproduction in Australia, they said. Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assistin maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in theCooper-Eromanga area. ""These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency inoil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in BassStrait production now under way,"" McGill said. In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelmansaid CSR was within days of completing plans for the float ofCSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso. He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decisionin view of the risks associated with the oil business. The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to shareequally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average morethan 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said. Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi tonet realisable value as of today, CSR's annual balance-date,will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs. However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assetswill significantly reduce this loss, he said. He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by futureprospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in corebusinesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payablein July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 centsagainst 18 in 1985/86.

Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuringprogram that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its owncommon shares and reincorporation in Delaware. The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retailstores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program. Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnershipsubsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposedreincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase andrestructuring plan. Under this latest arrangement, Lucky Stores said it agreedto reimburse the Edelman group for 2.8 mln dlrs ofout-of-pocket expenses, which include litigation and othercosts. ""This agreement serves the interests of Lucky stockholdersby avoiding the significant cost of continued litigation andthe accompanying demands on management time,"" Lucky Storeschairman John Lillie said in a statement.

2,"Southern Co said it will take anafter-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later thanJanuary 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclearpower plant has risen abover the amount which retail customersin Georgia will be asked to pay. The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, saidthe budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mlndlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the madelast year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increasedcost will not be included in the utility's retail electricrates. Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduledcompletion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added. The utility said fuel loading has been completed at UnitOne and the unit is being put through a series of low-powertests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for afull-power license. The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., isco-owned by &lt;Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal ElectricAuthority of Georgia and the city of Dalton. Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate wasdue to several factors, including additional labor costsincurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule forcommercial operation by June. The new figure represents thefirst change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when itwas estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs. In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would""cap"" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to payat 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Powersaid, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs. Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a chargeagainst earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes. In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contractswith the joint owners require the utility to buy backsignificant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant'sinitial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, itwill not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increasethat applies to the buybacks. This bings the total amount that must be charged againstearnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said. Southern said new rules of the Financial AccountingStandards Board, which are effective in January 1988, requireany costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be chargedagainst earnings once that determination is made. The company also said its board has approved a capitalbudget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on theVogtle project.

The company said the rising political controversy in theU.S. concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale ofthe Fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonabletime. The sale has been opposed by the U.S. Commerce Departmentand the U.S. Defense Department, in part on national securitygrounds. The company said termination of the agreement opened otherpossibilities, including a possible leveraged buyout of thesemiconductor maker by Fairchild management.

2,"Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <HWHH.HK>expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higherdividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not make any specific projections for the company'searnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend ofnot less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposedfour-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue. It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year,equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and sharesplit. Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading toproperty and container terminals, earlier reported after-taxprofits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mlndlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the SouthChina Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper,compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said itexpects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of theremaining shares. Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong whileits economy is performing better than forecast with its largelyexport-led growth. Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last yearagainst an initial government projection of 4.5 pct. But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S.May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affectthe British colony. He said all of the company's major operations showedimproved results in 1986. Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pctinterest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> to<Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off fromHongkong Electric.

1,"Crude oil prices rallied today, movingover 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determinedeffort to support prices, analysts said. ""The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this withoutanother meeting,"" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst withShearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ""But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due toseasonal declines in demand and some cheating,"" he added. Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attemptto get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount fromthe official prices agreed to last december. The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministersof the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at theCooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week. The Saudis have also offered to support members havingdifficulty in selling their oil, analysts said. ""They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and toprevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPECmember will allocate some of their oil sales to help membersthat lose sales,"" Margoshes said. He added that the allocations would probably be in the formof loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in linenations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But itis also likely that such assistance would be provided toNigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPECpresident Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPECmeeting for fear that it would give the appearance that theDecember pact is falling apart. Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, UphamHarris and Co said, ""both physical and futures markets have beenoversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a shortcovering rally."" He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, whichrefused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refinersinto the market to cover their short positions. Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the marketto but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideastsours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after tradingyeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into theNorth sea crude oil market. Traders said that there have been persistent rumors todaythat Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brentfor Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vesselsbeing fixed to make such shipments. North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with tradesreported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr. OPEC members' denials that they are producing over theirquotas sparked moves to cover short postitions. Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPECproduction was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to lastdecember but he gave no details on OPEC production againstclaims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level. ""The production probably is about their quota level andlargely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sellits oil as a result,"" Margoshes said. Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of thecurrent rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise ifSaudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount. But others said that despite the rally today there werestill several fundamental factors, including demand, whichcould cut the rally short. Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, saidslow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keepdemand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to riseabout 1.4 pct over 1986.

""For the short term the key word is confusion, Block VicePresident Tom Bloch said in an interview. ""When Congressdrastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparersbenefit,"" Bloch said. ""Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and placethem side by side to compare them, more people will throw theirhands up and say 'I'm going to get help,'"" he said.""Tax forms will look very different next year,"" he added.

For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bringclients into Block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide,there are some changes in the act that will have a negativeeffect, Bloch conceded. Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the taxreturn, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. Inaddition, some low income wage earners will be taken off thetax rolls, he said. Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try tooffset some of the negatives. Last tax season, the average costfor each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73dlrs worldwide, Bloch said. This tax season, rates will be upabout three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, hesaid. Block expects ""some expansion"" this tax season of itselectronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS andcan speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and byhow much it wants to expand into the seven cities madeavailable for the direct filing by the IRS, Bloch noted. The IRS estimates about 90,000 returns will be directlyfiled this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected inthe 1986 tax season. First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Blockwill benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988. Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about thesame as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs fortelevision ads. ""They may get a little more bang for theirbuck,"" he said. He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on itsbalance sheet sheet, and says if interest rates rise it couldbe of great benefit to them. "

""That could send prices50 cts to a dollar higher,"" he added. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week. The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell inFebruary more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs abarrel.

Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthlyreport said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or inindustrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd duringthe first quarter of this year.

5,"U.S. authorities intervened in theforeign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasionduring the period between the start of November 1986 and theend of January, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in areport. The Fed's quarterly review of foreign exchange operationssaid that the U.S. bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yenon January 28. This operation was coordinated with the Japanesemonetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and theU.S. Treasury. The Fed's intervention was on the morning after presidentReagan's State of the Union message and was ""in a mannerconsistent with the joint statement"" made by U.S. Treasurysecretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister KiichiMiyazawa after their January 21 consultations. At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness tocooperate on exchange rate issues. The Fed's report did not say at what level the interventionoccurred. But on January 28, the dollar closed at 151.50/60 yenafter dipping as low as 150.40 yen earlier in the session. Ithad closed at 151.05/15 yen the previous day. The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 149.98yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 1.7675 markson January 28. It ended that day at 1.7820/30 marks. The Fed noted that, after trading steadily throughoutNovember and the first half of December, the dollar movedsharply lower until the end of January. It closed the three-month review period down more than 11pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies andseven pct lower against the yen and sterling. It had fallenfour pct against the Canadian dollar. During the final days of January, pressure on the dollarsubsided. Reports of the U.S.-Japanese intervention operationand talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrialcountries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation onexchange rate and economic policy matters, the Fed said. Moreover, doubts had developed about the course of U.S.interest rates. The dollar's swift fall had raised questionsabout whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease. Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 1.8320 marksand 153.70 yen. According to the Fed's trade-weighted index, ithad declined nine pct since the beginning of the period. The dollar had risen as high as 2.08 marks and 165 yen inearly November. The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market onNovember 7, 1985 when it bought a total of 102.2 mln dlrs worthof marks and yen.

1,"The U.S. Congress and the oil industryare deeply divided on ways the government should assist theindustry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and thesubsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said. ""The industry is deeply divided between those who support anoil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,""said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy ResearchAssociates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.Congress on energy issues. Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for taxincentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee. Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he willpropose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and naturalgas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration forconsideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said theproposal would be reviewed. Herrington said, ""I would like to shoot for one mln barrelsa day (addition) to U.S. production."" U.S. oil output was off to8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from lastyear, the American Petroleum Institute said. Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to averageabout 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that amove above that level will be unlikey for the near term. Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that""even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we'veonly altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs forthe year."" Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling andexploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil outputwill not take place as the companies are waiting for stableprices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration. John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum IndustryResearch Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony toCongress said ""The continuing decline in U.S. oil production isvirtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. Butthe future rate of decline is very much a function of world oilprices and U.S. government policy."" Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oilproduction but would only work over time. ""Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probablybe a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase butwould not raise energy costs."" Lichtblau said. But the small independent oil companies who do much of thedrilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate reliefwhich could be brought on by an oil import fee. Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the InternationalAssociation of Drilling Contractors, said, ""The members of ourtrade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oilimport fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect ournation."" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oilservice companies. The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import feewill face a stiff uphill battle. Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January bya former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oilimport fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as ameans of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.  At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyedopposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff wouldhurt consumers and some regional interests. But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could growif production continued to fall and imports to rise. Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements""is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move abovethat level, a fee may not be legislated but there willcertainly be pressure for some form of action.""  But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, ""a 50 pctrate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990. In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energyrequirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added. "

Earnings from continuing retailoperations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs ashare compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago. K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said ""the success of theseprograms is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increasein 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxesto 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reachedthis milestone."" Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prioryear. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinuedoperations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over1985, it said. Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumeracceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, ""a marked increasein hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution fromspecialty retailing operations."" K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income fromcontinuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct. K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pctfrom 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general andadministrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pctin 1985. ""Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for KMart,"" Fauber said in a statement. ""In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused onchanging the look of our stores and the structure of thecompany."" K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for storeremodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system,upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialtyretailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructuredits long-term debt. ""We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form ofslower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investmentcommunity. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985,our improved performance is proof that our approach is correctfor the long term,"" the K Mart chairman said. "

5,"Global trading of yen bond futures isjust around the corner and they are expected to be listed soonon the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE)and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), bond managers said. ""Internationalisation of the yen through expansion ofoverseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success ofglobal trading of yen bond futures,"" said Katsuyuki Okayasu,general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond division. ""But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulusfor the LIFFE yen bond futures market,"" said Tetsuya Dezuka,deputy general manager of the money market section of New JapanSecurities Co Ltd, one of the most active yen bond brokers inLondon. Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets dependsbasically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond marketsoverseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there,dealers said. Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around140,000 billion yen, with most held in Japan, they said. An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February onmutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bondfutures trading in London and Chicago, enabling a continuous12-hour session, bond managers here said, adding the move wasmade with yen bond futures trading in mind. LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futuresafter receiving approval from Japan's Finance Ministry lastDecember. But futures markets will never take root unless they arebacked by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets, dealerssaid. Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market nowstand at 200 to 300 billion yen, but the extent of investor-linked transactions is unknown, securities bond managers said. ""Japanese corporations have been actively setting up theirfinancing companies in London, suggesting they increasingly areengaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,""Dezuka said. The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanesesecurities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. AndU.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market'sgrowth, dealers said. Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to bepromoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later thisyear, securities managers said. The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to applyto the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bondfutures contract, they said. The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited tradingfutures of designated foreign government debt securities notlocated in the issuing country. Fundamental Brokers Inc, a major U.S. Brokers' broker, hasdecided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in NewYork as early as April. CBOT's start of an evening session, planned for the end ofApril, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a NomuraSecurities Co Ltd bond manager said. But there are stillobstacles to trading on the London market. ""Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing aremajor obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE,"" said KokiChiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd'sbond administration division. Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanesesecurities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFEon these matters. Japan's Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds withcoupon payment of either March and September, or June andDecember from April 1, matching futures delivery months. The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July andDecember. When delivery months and coupon payments do notmatch, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earnedby non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securitiesmanagers said. LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount ofbonds with matching months increases to over several billionyen, bond managers said. These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they areexpected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to lowinterest rates, they said. Market participants here expect a clearing organisation tobe set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cashissues, making overseas listings probable in the latter half of1987. "

7,"French industry is failing to produce thegoods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has leftthe government little room for manoeuvre to reflate theeconomy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment said. With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pctthis year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climbto 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy. The report said the French economy was ""increasinglyill-adapted to demand"" selling goods at ""uncompetitive relativeprices on both domestic and export markets."" ""France's poor export performance reflects a geographicalbias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18months,"" it said. Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficitto around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against thefranc could lead to ""a (renewed) loss of competitivenessrelative not only to the United States but also to the newlyindustrialised countries."" This could result in further major losses of market share,particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost aquarter of French exports, it said. Until the competitive ability of industry improved, theauthorities would have ""little scope for macroeconomicmanoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need toencourage a pickup in investment could require demand to growmore briskly,"" it added. But rising unemployment could help to hold down wagedemands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around atwo pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said. Written mainly in December last year, the report took noaccount of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pctsurge in January consumer prices, caused partly by thegovernment's deregulation of service sector tariffs. ""We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provokerunaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet hasbeen lost,"" one OECD official commented. OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oilprices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in thereport, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecastto around 2.5 or three pct. The government last week revised its forecast up to between2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct. But the OECD backed the government's view that theunderlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year'sfall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause ofdisinflation. With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest inthe OECD area, the inflation differential between France andits main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just onepct this year, it said. On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices forindustrial goods and private services have been rising steeplyas companies built up their profits. ""For the disinflationary process to continue , and pricecompetitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchangerate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,""it said. "

0,"American Express Co, rumored to beconsidering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unitthat could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meetbroadening international competition. In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson saidthe actions under consideration are an integral part ofAmerican Express' worldwide financial services strategy andthat the two companies have been having both internal andexternal discussions on the matters. American Express said no decision has been reached on thestrategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimatelydecide to follow growth plans already in place. Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that thefinancial services giant was considering a spinoff of part ofShearson and there was speculation it may be consideringselling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said thespeculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct ofthe profitable brokerage firm to the public. There was some speculation that American Express had alsoconsidered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan wasconsidered highly unlikely, analysts said.  American Express said in the statement on Sunday that itwill not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesmanwould not go beyond the statement. The company also remainedsilent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove AmericanExpress stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring itto a Friday close at 74.  It said it issued the statement on Sunday because asimilar statement was being circulated to employees. Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense forAmerican Express to give up a stake in the wholly-ownedbrokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50pct in the last year. Some analysts said American Express may consider spinningoff part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stockprice does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.  Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. American Express' ambitious plans for international growthmay be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out partof Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all ofShearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.""(American) Express is in a position where they can raisecapital if they need to,"" said Larry Eckenfelder ofPrudential-Bache Securities. Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization ofShearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer JeffreyLane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.  The reorganization also created four new positions forchairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analystsspeculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.  Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement doeslittle to clarify last week's market speculation. It doesconfirm, however, that the financial services firm, whichunsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a majoracquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls forgrowth and positioning in the global market competition. Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts saidthere had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed whenit approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

Speaking to the New York Financial Writers' Association,Maxwell said he viewed this week's rise in U.S. banks' prime rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct as a temporary phenomenon. ""I don't see a substantial rise in rates this year. Ifanything, the Federal Reserve is more likely to ease than totighten (monetary policy) because so many sectors of theeconomy are showing weakness,"" Maxwell said. Fannie Mae buysmortgages from lenders and issues mortgage-backed securities. Maxwell said restructuring of Fannie Mae over the last twoyears had limited its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Aone pct rise in rates in 1987 would cost shareholders about 18cts a share versus one dlr a share in 1981, he said. Maxwell also questioned the view that housing crowds outother sectors of the economy from obtaining needed capital. ""There's no evidence that housing is crowding firms out ofthe long-term debt market,"" he said.

2,"Continental Illinois Corp's &lt;CIL>Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations toreschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to sixmonths. Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment ofinterest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium isexpected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talksare under way. ""I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer,for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil'sdebt,"" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing. ""I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Justhow long the run is is anybody's guess,"" Swearingen said. Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritoriummay force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrsand reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the firstquarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year. The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize theseloans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of theContinental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago,Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to aninquiry. Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and netincome equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use. Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses.Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducingoffice rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions. In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts ashare, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share. The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans andother assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC,during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the1984 restructuring agreement with the government. The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that itis entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987,Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate lossrather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans. In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle marketrose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S. Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bankwould like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 itbought three small suburban banks. Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will betaken over because no bank in the Midwest region is largeenough to buy it, and New York money center banks areprohibited by law from buying Illinois banks. He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over whowill eventually own the firm because it still holds theequivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln. The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and hassaid it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. Theagency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984bailout of the bank. Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head thestruggling banking firm after a career as an oil industryexecutive, said he will retire when the three-year period heagreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would notcomment on a successor. The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago optionsclearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said itsdoubtful lending to Japan will occur because that countrydoesn't need external sources of cash.

Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AXsports model, he said: ""All the budgetary forecasts that we havebeen able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvementin 1987, compared with 1986,"" he added. Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA &lt;PEUP.PA> group,increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct infirst two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It isaiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after11.7 pct in 1986. The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of theEuropean market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from2.9 pct in 1986. ""Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet thedemand,"" Calvet said. ""This is a relatively new problem for us."" Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cutthe deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to moderniseits range and improve productivity. Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs. This weekend he said that those profit estimates ""remainabout the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic."" Some of this optimism is due to the early success of theAX, launched on the French market last October. It will beavailable throughout most of western Europe within four months. The car has registered just over 20,000 sales. It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous-Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany andVigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of1,000 cars a day. The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate modelbetween its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed tocompete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa. The AX had built up its market share in France to aroundfour pct last month. Calvet said: ""Our hope is that once the AXis fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per centof the national market."" "

Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a ForeignMinistry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference wouldbe met by ""a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in theworld.""  U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarksapparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would dowhatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the faceof new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf. The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had beentold of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed athreat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf. U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-madeanti-ship ""Silkworm"" missiles, which pose a greater threat tomerchant ships than missiles used before. The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intendedto attack ships were ""misleading propaganda."" He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main causeof tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use ""allits legitimate means to stem the cause of tension."" Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. ""Weare fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shippinggoing and keep the freedom of navigation available in that veryvital waterway."" ""We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of whatmight happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to andlistening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance inkeeping navigation free in that area,"" he said. Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area werenot unusual. A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier KittyHawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea. The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as sayingthe U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in theregion. "

4,"The Association of German CooperativeBanks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rateswould continue to remain low for the time being. It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strongforeign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors inthe economy that could affect the long-term capital market. The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion forhigher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflationlate this year could give very slight grounds for a rise innominal rates at year's end and next year, it said. The association said generally low interest rates,prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expectedstrong domestic demand led it to believe that the investmentclimate would remain friendly and the economy would continueits slow but very sure growth. The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interestrates down on the short-term money market although its policieshad exerted little effect on the long-term capital market,which was so important for investment financing and thus forthe course of the economy, it said. In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policyhad in influencing the longer-term capital market, theassociation saw little sense in wanting to boost the economythrough a short-term and expansionist monetary policy. On the other hand it also saw no reason for stickingdogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987. The association said time would show to what extentspeculative foreign money and short-term invested domesticmoney would distort money supply developments.

Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mlnin February 1986 because of lower prices, he added. Fendt said that although the February results were lowerthan the average expected for the rest of the year, thegovernment's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of9.5 billion dlrs. Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrsand imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion. Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billiondlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line withgovernment plans to foster economic growth.

In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oiland wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion inthe same 1986 period.

The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 netearnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, againstanalysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln. CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend untillater this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputationto its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-freeto shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which thefull 49 pct company tax rate has been pid. The company operates on a substituted tax year, not thefiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax atthe 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement. Consequently, it has funds available for distribution withdividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputationlegislation before determining the final payout, it said. Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a pooryear for the minerals industry, with the notable exception ofgold producers. Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollarsdeclined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said. Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatilityand uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading tosubstantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said. World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories havesteadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,but overcapacity continues, CRA said. Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA saidBougainville Copper Ltd <BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrswhile its share of Comalco Ltd's <CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln. Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrsagainst 149.2 mln in 1985, it said. Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operationsincurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in1985, CRA said. Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrsagainst 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mlnfrom 2.8 mln. CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond projectamounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985. CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinaryloss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchangelosses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard. Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided forclosures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase infuture tax provisions, CRA said. Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrsbefore capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. Thestrong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rightsissue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debtto be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs. CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost. "

2,"Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has seen aslow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986,management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Credit business declined in the first few weeks of theyear, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weakGerman bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, andtrading in securities also fell. But earnings from currencydealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference. Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balancesheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion. Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of theformer Flick group, which have been estimated at some onebillion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank'sown account, not included in partial operating profits. Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through asubsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interestsurplus in a section current earnings from securities andparticipations. In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from1.45 billion. As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits. But it said that total operating profits, including ownaccount trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flicktransaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in theparent bank. Banking analysts said this put group total operatingprofits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bankoperating profits at over five billion marks. Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earningsfrom Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of itsunchanged 12 mark dividend. The bank had decided against raising the dividend itselfbecause of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986,and developments so far this year showed that was correct,Christians said. West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they aresure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequentyears, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits. The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue ahigh level of risk provision, Christians said. Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in1986 from 765 mln in 1985. Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarilyreflect the full amount of risk provisions. Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen saidDeutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallento over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985because of the fall in the dollar. He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds ofsuch problem country debt had been written off. Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of ""othersecurities,"" to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in theparent bank. Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly dueto its increased activity in international share placements,with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's internationalplacement last year remaining on its books. Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned toplace these shares and conclude the original placement. "

In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department'sperformance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said atleast 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new taxreform measures announced last year. He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA)this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors havecommitted ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pctfrom 1.3 billion in 1986. Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue baseincluded a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in1988. He gave no other details. He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels andthe volume of government securities sold to the private sectorhave improved significantly. ""In particular, short-term primeinterest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now downto less than 10 pct,"" he said. Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introducedin August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worthof applications, but selective evaluation had resulted inapprovals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February. He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisationprogram and the sale of non-performing assets owned byassociates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would helpfinance land reform. Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billionpesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failedcompanies will be used to finance the land reform plan. Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts toobtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the programfrom a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral andbilateral aid donors. The government has said the land reform plan aims todistribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants. "

6,"Hundreds of marines were on alertat 11 key Brazilian ports after 40,000 seamen decided to remainon indefinite strike, even after the Higher Labour Courtyesterday ruled it illegal, union leaders said. The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,started on February 27, and union leaders said they would notreturn to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipownershave offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected. ""We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off theworkers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with ourprotest until the end,"" a union leader said. He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marinestake over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels andlet the marines handle the situation by themselves. A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order tosend marines to take over the ports was given by Navy MinisterHenrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of nationalsecurity. But he said there were no incidents. The strike hascut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle. Petrol station owners in four states also continued theirshutdown and there were fears that the combination of the twostoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage. "

7,"Momentum in th U.S. economy may bepicking up given solid across-the board increases in theFebruary U.S. employment report, economists said. U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February,twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previouslyreported 448,000 increase. ""Even if you look at January and February together, this isstill a much stronger report than the consensus expectation inthe market,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal muchlarger gains in February U.S. production and income thanpreviously forecast. The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week sinceNovember 1966, the Commerce Department said. ""The gains in manufacturing employment point to a verylarge increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7pct,"" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production. Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Incnoted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hourin February from 8.83 dlrs in January. ""Combined with the increase in hours worked, this meanswe'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-visthe wage and salary disbursement,"" he said. Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income shouldrise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January. He said the February employment gains are consistent withhis firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national productgrowth forecast of 3.7 pct. Economists agreed that the employment data were negativefor the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economyand no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Butmost said that the market need not fear tighter policy either. ""This report is another reason for the Fed to not considereasing,"" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. ""It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,"" hesaid. ""If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,but it's most likely they'll sit and wait."" ""The data have not been uniform,"" Stone added. ""Durablegoods were weak in January and now employment is strong."" In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gapwidened to 14.8 billion dlrs. ""Things just aren't adding up,"" said Steve Slifer of LehmanGoverment Securities Inc. ""Consumer spending, capital spending,goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak firstquarter GNP growth of one pct,"" he said. ""The employment and production data point to a biginventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourthquarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth."" Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain wasaccounted for by striking workers in the steel and machineryindustries returning to work. Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gainshave resulted from an improving trade outlook. Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exportsgrew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase inimports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improvein the first quarter. ""Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paperproducts, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods showthat trade is improving,"" Benderley said. ""The economy is moving between extremes,"" he said. ""Somereports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarterGNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct."" A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greaterpart of February's employment gain. Retail services employmentrose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 inJanuary, previously reported at 166,000. Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. Butthis follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised downfrom a previously reported 142,000 gain. The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged inFebruary at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading sinceMarch 1980, the Commerce Department noted. ""The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,""Carson said. ""This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that.""    "

Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement. Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar'sweakness against the mark and oil and raw materials pricefalls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year. The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery andplant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales. Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineeringbusiness achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions hadunderpinned machinery and component activities. An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, thetrading and services sectors, affected the group's total orderfigures. However, ""all business sectors contributed to the positiveresults achieved in 1986,"" Krupp added, without giving details. Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marksfrom the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9billion, it said.

Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased bythree pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said. The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration inforeign trade and a downturn in a number of customerindustries.

5,"German banking authorities areweighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in anattempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticatedcapital market instruments, banking sources said. Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options areunder closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they mayresemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. ToJapan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division ofbanking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-Britishproposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate. But banking sources said West Germany was more likely toproduce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals. ""There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latterstages,"" one representative of the German Banking Association inCologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year. All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, WestGermany's four major banking associations and the FederalBanking Supervisory Office. Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changeswould require a revision of Germany's credit law, which hasbeen in effect since 1934. Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fitpresent circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentarypolitical process of changing it, banking sources said. Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limitedbanks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves,on a consolidated basis. But lending ratios do not extend to several newerinstruments such as spot and forward currency contracts,currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs,currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currenciesand various innovative types of interest rate hedges. The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposalslay in differentiating between different types of risk factor,and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swapsthan interest swaps. But even if German banking authoritiesagree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree onhow to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk. U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series offormulae for assessing the stream of payments involved inswaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financialintermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous.This is the so-called market-to-market value. But German authorities are likely to consider this much toocomplex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule oflending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness ofthe borrowers involved, the sources said. The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extendedto include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for publicauthorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreignbanks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers. A further complication is that the more flexibledefinitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May putGerman banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said. Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version ofthe U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S.And British authorities, the sources said. One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-datedforeign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, bebrought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despitethe fact that the risk may be entirely different. How new regulations will affect foreign banks here wasuncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status andapplied for a full banking licence over the last two years inorder to lead-manage mark eurobonds. But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lendingratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement,particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if theyare required to include more transactions in the balance sheet,the sources added.

Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetingswith the 10 premiers, Mulroney said further discussions wouldbe held in June and September to discuss the role of theprovinces in approving any new trade deal. But he maintained progress was being made in the sweepingtalks with the Unites States that got under nearly two yearsago. ""It appears reasonable progress is being made (in thetalks),"" Mulroney said. Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed, ""Things are running prettyquickly now."" The talks, launched by Mulroney's Progressive Conservativegovernment after concerns about protectionist sentiment in theU.S., are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between theworld's largest trading partnership. But the provinces are expected to play a major role in anynew trading arrangement, and some of the provincial leaderscomplained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratificationformula. ""It's my view that we should be thinking about these thingsright now, along with the questions of the substance of theagreement,"" commented Ontario Premier David Peterson, who hasbeen highly critical of the talks in the past. But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreementwas more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be noneed for a ""hard and fast formula.""

0,"Trans World Airlines Inc complicatedthe bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buyPiedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge withPiedmont and USAir. Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Streetspeculated the board was discussing opposing bids from NorfolkSouthern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortlyafter the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. Italso said it was the largest shareholder of USAir andthreatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offerfor 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal forUSAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it saidit alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of theairlines. Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairmanCarl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline intothe takeover arena. ""We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWAinto play. There's speculation on the street he just wants tomove onto somthing else,"" said one arbitrager. ""We think TWAmight just be putting up a trial balloon."" Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,but that the airline will probably reject it because the priceis relatively low compared to other airline deals. They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible byrevealing financing arrangements. ""They need to show theircommitment and their ability to finance. I think it's acredible offer,"" said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst. ""I think it's certainly on the low end of relative valuesof airline deals,"" said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs wouldbe in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. Aspokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had notchanged its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct ofthat airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balancefor 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock. USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mlnshares. Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, alsoremained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck withits offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmontand opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeoverof Piedmont. Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir tomake his own airline a more attractive takeover target. ""Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and therewere no takers. I think the strategy might have called formaking his investment more attractive. One way to accomplishthat specific objective is to go out and acquire otherairlines,"" said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming. ""I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least thisway it becomes a much more viable package,"" said Kim. But Icahn's financing ability for such a transactionremains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load. Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to dothe offer. The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financialadvisers and plans to make his own arrangements.   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp <X>and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock. Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan wasimpacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal. Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWAoffer on price and financing concerns. ""It's littered withcontingencies and it doesn't even have a financingarrangement,"" said one executive at another major airline. But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be astrong contender with USAir's east coast route system andplanned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed theintenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence inits St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,to the mix would develop an even stronger force. The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservationsystem. Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it wouldresult in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share. "

4,"The World Bank intends to bringborrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because itexpects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bankvice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said. He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan,West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. ""The weightof opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higherprobability there will be one pct higher than one pct lowerinterest rates,"" he said. The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so farthis year because of the expectation of higher interest rates. The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at alevel that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where andhow much to borrow, Rotberg said. Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years'anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstandingdebt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years. Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, itdid not intend to launch new financial instruments just for thesake of innovation, Rotberg said. Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only someeight billion had been swapped into another currency. Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors orunfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident thatthis was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments. The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed overthe next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However,for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out newinstruments such as bonds with warrants. The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germanysince the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.&#3;"

But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on theirown doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have notrisen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiariesof soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese andKorean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack. ""In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington wasJapan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing,"" said Robert Chandross, ofLloyds Bank PLC. Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singaporeand Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986. The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral tradedeficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion. And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend iscontinuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. Thegap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago. Lately both nations have said they will take steps todefuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing manyof the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut importtariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation. Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said lastweek that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three tofive years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cuttariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 andtry to diversify exports. But vice economic minister WangChien-Shien said last month that he still does not expectTaiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987. The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textilesand electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in thearea of ""big-ticket"" manufactured goods, notably cars. Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America-- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985. ""The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. Whentheir exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturingbase. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,"" said BobWendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp. The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports,72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of itstelecommunications equipment. A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan andSouth Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S. While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with theU.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries. But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand inmarked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly intolarge bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall tradeand current account surpluses, the Morgan study says. Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, andKorea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion. Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S. ""A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have beenat Japan's expense,"" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp. February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powersexorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies. But this two-pronged approach has drawn little responsefrom the two nations so far and, in any case, will only workwith a sizeable lag, economists say. The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's andKorea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which ispegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct sinceSeptember 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct. But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat againstthe U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say. ""We've not seen any lessening of competition from thosecountries that we can attribute to currency changes,"" saidBethlehem Steel's Wendt. And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use theirhefty export earnings to import more have had little effect. Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism willget given the administration's free-trade stance. ""It's hard tosee that anything will be passed much before year-end. And thenthe question is, will it have teeth?"" one economist said. "

5,"Sudan has rejected a demand by theInternational Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation becausesuch a move would have a negative impact on its economy, theofficial Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said hisgovernment also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidieson basic consumer goods. SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation,said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoumyesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan. Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, issome 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared itineligible for fresh loans in February last year. In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation ofits pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchangerate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency. Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditorsfor more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluationshad failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices.Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollarfor foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers. Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollarwas sold at 5.5 pounds today. With stringent import regulations and the governmentincreasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollarsare used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouringcountries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire. Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMFand Sudanese government officials do not amount to formaltalks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan'seconomic performance. The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economicrecovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a seriousattempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuadeits Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears. This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill ofhealth from the IMF that it could take to Western governmentcreditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, toreschedule debt payments. Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed tomembers of the Paris Club, the diplomats said. Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMFrepresentative had told him the fund's executive board was ""verypleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the pastcouple of months."" The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing DirectorMichel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudanowes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more. Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrsbut set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in thefiscal year ending next June 30. "

Several other Mediterranean refineries are currentlyshutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled somemonths ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may havebeen rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude.  Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products marketsbullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said.

However, Lynch would not comment specifically on thecurrent market rumors.

Someanalysts said the company should be bringing in new products,but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.

He said the company hasimproved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a highpercent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500. ""They also have some attractive leaseholds on theirrestaurants,"" Murren said. Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in thefourth quarter. ""That was about the first time in sevenquarters,"" he said. Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something couldbe going on with Wendy's. ""My gut feeling is something's goingto happen. I don't know what,"" she said. She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrsper share. One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitorbecause Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains insteadof Pepsi.

President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing adetermination that the country never again become captive to aforeign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages andsharp prices increases of the 1970s. The report said an import fee would raise prices and helpmake it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce newoil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax woulddepress the nation's economy. The study was outlined in a New York Times report today. "

2,"London and Scottish Marine Oil Plc(Lasmo) &lt;LASL.L> will have an advantage when oil prices riseagain and it is confident this will happen early in the nextdecade, the company said in a statement accompanying results. Lasmo said its advantage comes from its reserves of oil andgas which at the end of 1986 stood at 210 mln barrels of oilequivalent, a group record. Reserves have increased every yearsince 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year. The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg,down from 118 mln in 1985. It said falling oil prices caused the downturn. The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop inoil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure,which had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mlnstg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand forlower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide. The company said had very few exploration wells committedfor 1987 and therefore retains maximum flexibility in itsexploration program. Even without further success, the existingfields and recent discoveries will contribute significantly toprofit and cash flow for some years to come, it said.

7,"The DIW economic research institutesaid West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reachthe 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year. The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic thanthose of the other four leading German institutes, said theeconomy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and itsprospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn. The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross nationalproduct (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract inreal, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarterof last year.  The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in theremaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand andproduction would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to1.5 pct. Other institutes and economists have recently revised theirforecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct. In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists thatthe economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demandhealthy but foreign demand weak. DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand forcapital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumergoods, not between foreign and domestic demand. It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had beenhit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which hadcaused West German firms to scale back investment plans. Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, werecontinuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand,it said. In a separate report the HWWA economic research institutein Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fallmarkedly this year. However, the nominal trade surplus would show little changefrom 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a furtherimprovement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 comparedwith 1986, it said.

4,"British bank base lending rates arelikely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct thisweek following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K.Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set intoday's 1987 budget, bank analysts said. The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and moneymarkets had already started to reward. Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and moneymarket interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budgetmeasures came through, the analysts said. Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said heexpected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow. ""This is very much a safety-first budget in order to getinterest rates down,"" he said. Bootle said the money markets had almost entirelydiscounted such a one point cut, with the key three monthinterbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, andit would be rather conservative for banks to go for ahalf-point cut now. Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday,but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts. ""This budget is designed to please both the markets and theelectorate. The implications for interest rates are veryfavourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and anothersuch cut before the end of the week,"" Simmonds said. Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, hesaid Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cutin income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target.""There is no real need to boost private consumption,"" he said. National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern saidthe lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased thelikelihood of an early one-point base rate cut. Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve thesharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-pointbase rate cut could be implemented. But providing the budget small-print was convincing, ""and Isuspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see onepoint off base rates by the end of this week,"" Kern said. Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pavethe way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumerprice inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said. U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, moneyand government bonds (gilts) markets. But building societies said they would not cut lendingrates until base rates had fallen by one full point. "

4,"Quarter-point prime rate increases to7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will befollowed by other banks only after they see clearer signs ofthe Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said. ""Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and theprime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, butno rush is likely,"" said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co. Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed byChase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher. McCulley said that once the spread between three-monthcertificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a primerate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently. However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until theysee what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the nearterm, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like tofollow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when bankslifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discountrate increase in April of that year. Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate sincelast August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pctshortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to thecurrent 5-1/2 pct level on August 20. ""The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. Thereshould be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G.Lanston and Co. Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today'smeeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed maywell foster higher interest rates soon. Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policychange today, it may have decided to apply slight upward ratepressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heatup or the economy shows sign of strong recovery. ""The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend totighten policy when they did today's coupon pass,"" said JosephLiro of S.G. Warburg and Co. In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, theFed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system byoffering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds forits own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a ""pass."" ""The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policychange,"" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean WitterReynolds Inc.  She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and theprime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is notreally narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rateincrease. The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise""may have been less a response to interest rates than anattempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line."" Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans todeveloping countries, large money center banks with heavyexposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate inan effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans. The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight moneyto one another could help determine how many banks match thehigher prime rate and also how quickly they move. In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost offunds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federalfunds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.   The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflectingdemand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and theclose of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between fiveand 6-3/4 pct. Once the special distortions end, analysts said the fundsrate probably will return to its recent trading level in the6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.

He told a press conference that in confirming theCommission's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988,he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989. The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss inthe current financial year but this could be carried over andmet from next year's revenues. This year's deficit resulted from the landslide which costthe canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This includedeight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest beingspent on earth-moving operations to prevent any furtherlandslides. He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation andhe described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was anythreat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future.

2,"A spokesman for PreussagAG &lt;PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the companywould pay a dividend on 1986 results He was commenting on a Preussag statement which saidresults in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag hasfrequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986following a difficult year in 1985. Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said inDecember the board would prefer to stick to its policy of notdipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted thefinal dividend decision rests with the supervisory board. The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 comparedwith 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil andshipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends inthe group's other divisions. The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domesticgroup would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would dependpartly on the level of provisions. Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from ninemarks on 1984 results after parent company net profit droppedto 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before. The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marksin 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln. The statement said its results in 1986 were affected byunsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as bypoor use of capacity in the supply ship sector. The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarterof 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was anadditional factor behind the drop in results. Preussag said rationalization measures already introducedwould not begin to take full effect until this year. Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billionmarks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the firsttime consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from itsmajority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG. Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alonewas 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparisonfigures. Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production roseto 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes. Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)subsidiary, whose results are included in the world groupaccounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter oflast year. AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by theinternational tin crisis, were the reason behind the worldgroup losses that year. "

4,"U.S. February reports reflecting slimgains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressuresreinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continueto follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said. ""If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything,"" saidSteve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc. ""There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflationfront, all is well,"" he said. ""Money supply is well undercontrol. It's an absolutely ideal situation."" February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightlyless than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's productionnumber, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase. The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pctrise in the PPI in January. ""The Fed is going to look at this positively,"" said AllanLeslie of Discount Corporation. ""Certainly inflation is not asbad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrialproduction growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants."" The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct inFebruary, after a 9.8 pct increase in January. ""This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflationis behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs perbarrel,"" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ""Thetrend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year."" In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pctdecline in the PPI. Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car pricesfell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said thata possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in boththe financial markets and the Federal Reserve. ""The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectationstoday,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International. While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easiermonetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise thiscould necessitate a weaker dollar. ""The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,"" hesaid. ""We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete withforeign producers."" Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pctin February's PPI. With many electronic goods producedoverseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raisingprices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said. If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminishoverseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which mightnecessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices. By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting toa large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real valueof the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987. Slifer said import prices may rise further asmanufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar droppedto current levels expire, and new contracts are made thatreflect a weaker dollar. David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that importedmanufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in thesecond half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.industrial output. ""It's the other side of the lower dollar,"" Wyss said.""Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitiveand they are increasing output."" Wyss said that the latest data point to an averageindustrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.""It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector isbeginning to revive."" But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. Hesaid much of the strength came from factors that do not pointto a sustained rise in industrial output. Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farmequipment industries helped account for a one pct rise inFebruary business equipment production. Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energywas produced, not that manufacturing activity gained. Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted forhalf of the industrial production gain as production of autoassemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5million units. ""In the first quarter, it looks like automakers areproducing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling atroughly a seven mln unit rate,"" Roach said. ""The disparitybetween output and sales is showing up in inventories."" Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. businessinventories as a sign that production may be outstrippingdemand in the first quarter of 1987. January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gainsince July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the CommerceDepartment said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, thelargest monthly sales drop on record. Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react tomonth-to-month changes. ""The Fed has been standing pat for thelast seven months,"" Ramirez said. ""They will continue to standpat for at least the next couple of months."" "

Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a newsconference he expected both profit and turnover to rise thisyear compared with 1986, but he said it was questionablewhether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels. He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted lastyear that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecifiedamount from 1985's record levels. Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10billion this year. Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help theparent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audiwould ensure VW got a share of profits. Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own freereserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 yearsVW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend. Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to outputcaused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, oncurrency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. Aboutalleged ""sudden acceleration"" of some of its Audi 5000 models. As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pctto 59,800 last year. Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottomout in 1987. Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000. Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180in 1985. Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in thefirst two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overallmarket share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in thesame months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Salesfell further, he said without giving details. Worldwidedeliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to57,000. Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise toover 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallencompared with 1985's 392,000.

1,"A 10 percentagepoint reduction in the Australian government's maximum crudeoil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output,resources analyst Ian Story said here. A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Straitoutput to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrelsper day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum ExplorationAssociation annual conference. Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydneystockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd. Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longerappropriate in the current economic climate, Story said. The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discoveredbefore September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty CoLtd &lt;BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp &lt;XON> partnership to shut-inproduction, accelerating the decline in output and reducinggovernment revenue, he said. He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrsif the levy was cut to 70 pct. ""The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractiveat oil prices below 30 dlrs,"" Story said. Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higherlevels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boostexports and provide incentives for exploration and development,he said.

In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlinedfour conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific. Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into anagreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilitesof Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and thatthe financial condition of Southern remain largely unchangedfrom today onward. ""We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market valueoffer in cash for the Southern Pacific,"" said Kansas CitySouthern president and chief executive officer Landon H.Rowland. ""This offer disproves the constant derogation of theSourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSPChief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that theSouthern Pacific was 'bankrupt,'"" said Rowland. He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achievethe benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving theindependece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing primecompetitor, Santa Fe. Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated thevalue of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to1.2 billion dlrs. It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon BrothersInc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in theirmerger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations. Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer forSouthern after its books, records and properties are examined. ""Once that examination has been completed (and even in theabsence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make anoffer in writing...."" said the company. Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fehad not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission'sreconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and SouthernPacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel eachother throughout their routes. ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger asinherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioningfor reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreementswith the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western andother railroads, adds to the value of the merger.

7,"Africa may have to follow Brazil inhalting foreign debt payments unless industrialised nations areprepared to be more flexible in trade and economic policy,Ethiopian trade minister Tesfay Dinka said. Growing protectionism and declining commodity prices hadcaused a major deterioration in the export earnings of alldeveloping countries, he said in an opening speech to a meetingof African trade ministers in Addis Ababa. Unless there was an early improvement in developingcountries' terms of trade ""the only choice is to follow theroute that Brazil appears to have taken,"" Tesfay said.   The two-day meeting of delegates from 50 African states wascalled to work out a consensus ahead of the Group of 77ministerial meeting in Havana next month, when the developingcountries will debate their strategy in economic negotiationswith the West. Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiationof recent commodity agreements. The failure of the International Coffee Organisation toagree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean ""severalAfrican countries will not have the foreign exchange to importessential items,"" he said. Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and therecent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced thecountry's foreign exchange earnings. Adebayo Adedeji, the executive secretary of the U.N.Economic Commission for Africa, told the meeting that there wasan increasing net outflow of resources from Africa. He blamed this on high interest rates, debt servicing andthe repatriation of profits by foreign investors. Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreigndebt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expectedto rise to between 16 and 24 billion, Adedeji said. He accused industrialised countries of failing to providemore resources to implement the U.N. Program for Africa'seconomic recovery and development, despite Africa's willingnessto raise two thirds of the capital from domestic sources. The U.N. Program, approved last year, calls for 128 billiondlrs of economic investment in Africa over five years. Western donors were asked to contribute 46 billion dlrs,with the rest being raised from local resources, but Adedejisaid the donors had not responded as hoped.   In view of this poor response, he said ""it is possible thatby the year 2,000 nearly all African countries, except a few,will be categorised as least developed countries."" At present, 27 of Africa's 50-odd states are officiallylisted in this category. "

""The adoption of such measureswould not fail to have a negative effect on the process ofmultilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateralrelations,"" it said.

7,"Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta planthis month aimed at boosting exports to reach EuropeanCommunity levels, director-general of the INFE exportinstitute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said. ""The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross DomesticProduct over the next four years compared to 15 pct now,"" hesaid.  ""This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and thereis no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy,which have a similar productive structure,"" he said. The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and otherfiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence ininternational trade fairs. Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well astraditional industrial exports will be promoted. Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while thegovernment's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special25 billion peseta grant. The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct inreal terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year. Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand indeveloping countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985. He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went toOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)countries. The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to theCommunity rose seven pct last year. The government plans toconcentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S. ""The problem is convincing businessmen that exports arevital to survival in the context of EC competition,"" he said. He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to thedomestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, whileturning their backs on foreign markets. ""They have to realise their share of the home market isgoing to shrink with growing deregulation,"" he said.

The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of theU.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over importedproducts. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did nothave the same possibilities for defending themselves before theITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court. ""Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourablethan that which takes places in normal courts of law for goodsproduced in the United States,"" it said in a statement. "

2,"Canada's airline industry, shaken up bya recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor forgovernment-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drivefor profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said. ""Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,""said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.""Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market."" The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlrtakeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small butcash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last weekas Canadian Airlines International Ltd. Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about ninepct. Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive andcost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the truepotential of the former CP Air, which floundered for fourdecades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian PacificLtd. They said CP Air's management style had been not muchdifferent from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, becauseneither airline was held accountable to its owners. ""Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, thesetwo airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neitherseemed that concerned about the bottom line,"" said Bradley. ""But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be veryconscious of profitability and shareholder return. And AirCanada is on the verge of going that way,"" he said. CP Air, always fighting for market share rather thanprofits, was ""a perennial money-loser,"" analyst Wilfred Hahn ofBache Securities Inc said in a recent report. Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulatedlong-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, itslosses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs. Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later thisyear in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs onrevenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of morethan 2 billion dlrs. Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold tothe public, the prospect of privatization at a time ofincreased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay moreattention to finances, analysts said. It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit ""inexcess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs"" for 1986. However, this profitrecovery was due less to management skill than the fact thatall Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said. Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 inVancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors. For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct airtraffic growth, and they expect profits will come fromcost-cutting and careful spending. Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd saidinstitutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to theirportfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that newcompetition makes profit growth less certain. ""The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. Atone time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobodyelse's,"" Friend said. Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airlineshares for at least a year. Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of apublic stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routeswithout setting off a political storm. It also will be faced with an expensive but necessaryupdating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft. Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase ofa dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie. Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week orderedsix commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it wouldsoon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or theBoeing Co. Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these withouthurting profits. Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects CanadianAirlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western. "

7,"Tense trade relations with the U.S.And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposedEuropean Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats areexpected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers heretomorrow. EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on theEC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax ondomestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off aproposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations. The proposal was the most controversial part of a reformpackage, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later thismonth, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen asthe root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and oftensions with major trading partners. The proposal is described by its promoters as astabilisation program which would penalise a new sector goinginto massive overproduction and complement proposals to cutcereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forwardtax. They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fatsproduction and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left bya fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some twobillion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farmcosts. It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers aswell as foreign exporters, led by the United States. The diplomats said the protests had been received from mostcorners of the developing and developed world, ranging fromSenegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada,Iceland and Norway. The proposal had little chance of approval by ECgovernments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it asBritain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal alsounconvinced of its political or economic wisdom. Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France andGreece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did notseem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added tothe list of products affected. But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S.And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promoteanti-EC action, and the foreign ministers' debate shoulddemonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal withinthe EC and deprive its oponents of this argument. The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in theU.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as abill that would curb EC textile exports. The diplomats said the ministers were expected to stronglyback a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, ifenacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation. "

2,"One of General Electric Co's biggestbusinesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasingprofits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,Wall Street analysts said. Previously, it was expected the business would peak anddecline at some point in the next five years. The improvedoutlook results from AMR Corp's <AMR> decision to order 40 newplanes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines. ""Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order,"" saidNicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangementsfor its order of 15 Boeing Co <BA> and 25 <Airbus Industrie>twinjet long distance aircraft. But AMR said it was using ""rent-a-plane leases"" that allowit to operate the aircraft without adding to its debtstructure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of theplanes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protectsAMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severedownturn in the economy. From GE's point of view the package looks like a good dealfor several reasons, Heymann said. GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time ofdelivery, Heymann noted. And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planesGE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,would have little trouble rounding up another airline thatwanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the dealappears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said. GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares bymidafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Uphamand Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company ""no oneorder will have much of an effect on the stock."" Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said theorder ""will help to maintain a good level of production andprofitability in the aircraft engine business"" for GE. Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet enginebusiness rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrsby 1991. Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs lastyear, with well over half of the business in the militarysector, according to analysts' estimates. The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincideswith an upbeat performance in other segments. Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the firstquarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corpthat it has a ""unique ability"" to buy a major business andreshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with otherelements of its 14 business areas. Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the currentquarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by theNBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates. Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in partcrediting ""significant benefits from the RCA acquisition."" "

The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNGon the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he toldthe Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annualconference. Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-WestCenter in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacificpetroleum outlook. With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd)and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991,PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharakisaid. The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the bestoil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG. The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paperdistributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves atabout 500 mln barrels. PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region withno secondary taxes, Fesharaki said. ""We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, anddiscovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to(light) Bass Strait crude,"" Fesharaki said. There are also large pockets of high quality condensates tobe produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which iscapable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said. But prices should be somewhat higher than the presentlevels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.

The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday toPresident Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New ZealanderBruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pctof the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from thegovernment. The presidential office and Ariadne representatives inManila were not available for comment on the report. The shares are the entire block seized by the governmentfrom the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion thatthe real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman ofSan Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed presidentFerdinand Marcos. The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14mln class B shares. Government officials have said earlier that the morevaluable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners. The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price atwhich the Philippine Social Security System suggested it mightbuy eight mln class A shares last week.

5,"Central banks have easily beaten backthe foreign exchange market's first test of the industrializednations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said. In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar,sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. Butoperators got their fingers burned as one by one the centralbanks signalled their displeasure. ""So far G-6 has been a roaring success,""said James O'Neill,financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA. ""The central banks are sending strong signals that theywon't tolerate any kind of momentum building behindcurrencies,"" added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank. On February 22, the finance ministers and central bankgovernors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K.-- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord underwhich they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability ofexchange rates around prevailing levels. The agreement was viewed by many in the market as anattempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeabletwo-year decline against major world currencies. And initially, traders indicated their respect for theaccord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower. But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday beforethe G-6 accord. The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economypicked up steam in February at the same time as the West Germaneconomy was regressing. But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gavetraders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed theidea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines. Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bankactually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simplytelephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about tradingconditions. But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around1.85 marks. ""The market was surprised that the Fed showed itsface so soon,"" said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill. Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of Englandintervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K.currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before theG-6 pact. Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies likethe Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor aftertraders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuantto the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit playson dollar/mark and dollar/yen. The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improvingU.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for theincumbent Conservative party in any general election. ""There was a real run on sterling,"" said Anne Mills ofShearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterdayand from a peak of about 2.98 recently. ""There's been someheavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday'sU.K. budget,"" said James McGroarty of Discount Corp. As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. andBritish central banks, they acclerated their shift intoCanadian and Australian dollars. But here too they werestymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise. The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollartoday, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday. And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent,sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said. The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. centstoday from a high of 69.02 Thursday. Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle suddenupward movement, leave the market uncertain about its nextstep. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to avery tight range against the dollar for several months. The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night.Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound longsterling/short mark positions established lately. ""Because of the change in perceptions about the health ofthe German economy, the funds from those unwinding operationsare ending up in yen,"" a dealer at one U.K. bank said. Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders,lower industrial output and slowing employment gains. Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities whohave invested heavily overseas, for example in Australianfinancial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of theend of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31. Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the mostcontroversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit withJapan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test ofthe dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency. In its latest review of the foreign exchange market throughthe end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that itintervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28.On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen. ""Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level inJanuary. But the market has to bear in mind that time marcheson and the situation changes,"" said McGroarty of Discount. "

1,"Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oilproducers, announced today, are aimed at encouragingdevelopments in the North Sea to go ahead and boostopportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the InlandRevenue said in a post-budget statement. Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announcedin his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companieswill be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifyingdevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields againstPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on anindividual field itself, when its income stream began, but wasnot immediately available against other developmentexpenditure, the statement said. The new relief will apply to fields outside the southernbasin for which developmentconsent is first given on or after today, and will improve thepost-tax economics of new developments and encourage companiesto proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said. Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allowcertain expenditure on oil related research which does not atpresent qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRTliability. This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on theU.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in aparticular field within three years of being incurred, to beallowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the InlandRevenue said. This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs morein line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned toencourage general research into ways of reducing fielddevelopment costs, it said. In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mlnstg a year, it calculated. The Inland Revenue statement also included other technicalmeasures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech. These included measures to allow companies to balance theirshares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in twopast periods of allowance utilisation. Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefswere announced, while there were also ammendments on rules oncorporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to theso-called ""ring fence"" of activities in the U.K. And itscontinental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions forthe implementation of measures announced in November, it said. Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokersWood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefson PRT would help the depressed offshore industry. He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief wouldfavour chances that development of smaller North Sea fieldssuch Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward. Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fieldsmight also be encouraged, he said. Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshoreconstruction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offsunder the price slump of more than 50 pct last year. He pointed out that the relief only applies to thedevelopment of new fields outside the Southern Basin. This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in thecentral and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper thanin the south and thus have greater capital and labourrequirements as the waters are deeper than in the south. He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditurewould help fundamental research in the oil industry, althoughthe benefits of this research would not be seen for severalyear. "

The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previousyear and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's sharecapital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986from 2.7 billion a year earlier. Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference whenthe bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profitof 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985. Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast. The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total roseto 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion. General director Hannes Androsch said higher investmentwould lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Lastyear's better profits had resulted from improvements inservices provided by the bank and also in profits on schillinglending. Schilling lending had grown last year and interest ratemargins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory whencompared with those in other countries, he said. Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home andabroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits,Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure. Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business hadfallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations,removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheettotal. In an attempt to generate more foreign business,representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, HongKong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans toabolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares anddrawing dividends. Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt roseeight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokerssaid improved results had been widely expected by investors. Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria'slargest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized andlarge Austrian companies.

Results in the first few months show it heading inthe right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said. The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swissfrancs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividendper bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs. Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded thecompany's target of five pct real annual growth, had been madepossible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year. Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economicaffairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24billion francs was due to currency factors. A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offsetby growth in operations and by structural changes within thegroup. Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francsfrom 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolatesector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. Thetonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices andlower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany. Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germanyto 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result ofacquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25pct against 25.3 pct. Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pctfrom 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despitewrite-offs on the losses of new acquisitions.

Banksbuilt up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow. The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billionmarks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time asan earlier securities repurchase pact matured. Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as sixbillion marks. The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman saidyesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to rollover, the possibility that other central banks may choose toredeem them meant a net infusion was needed. Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks,but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week. Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over thefirst nine days of March. Dealers said although the figure was well above an expectedrequirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow offunds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meetthe requirement toward the end of March.

It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for theyear ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 wasalso aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt andgreater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents pershare final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage ofproposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first andfinal of one cent in 1985.

But total operating and extraordinary profits, includingearnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's ownaccount and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms,were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said. BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB'scapital increase, which is to finance the insurance company'sacquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG. Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid anunchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred anunchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company,&lt;Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from whichAMB has acquired the majority stake. The bank has said its business last year suffered from theturbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housingconcern Neue Heimat. AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus. The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in theinterest margin to 1.9 pct. A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this. The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step uprisk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasisedbecause of the continuing difficulties of some countries. Disclosed risk provisions, which under West Germanaccounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln. BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pctof this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.

""People don't seem to have any firm conviction about thecurrent strength of the economy or about the Federal Reservedoing anything,"" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst NormanMains. The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on tradingvolume, he noted. ""We've had a decline in activity as recenteconomic statistics have not greatly changed people'sviewpoints on interest rates,"" Mains said. The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of theeconomy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchangemarkets after the Paris initiative has made for ""less thanebullient market action,"" Mains said. He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be infor a retracement after the recent rise as they are near thetop of the trading range. ""My view is that the economy remains relatively strong andmarket participants will see that current prices areunjustified,"" Mains said. Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also notedthat the market is showing very little momentum and lacksretail interest. ""All of the movement occurs at the opening,""afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said. Although data during the week was mildly positive for bondprices, the small rise in February producer prices and downwardrevisions in January retail sales and industrial productionwere ""not real exciting,"" said Prudential Bache analyst FredLeiner. ""There is no one factor that will push us through the highsat this moment,"" Leiner said. Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross nationalProduct is also likely to be of little interest to the market,said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan.Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in thedirection of bond prices over the next month. Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth isaround three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventoriesreflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showedthe largest increase since 1979. ""The key question will be not whether there is a largeincrease in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase issustainable or a one shot deal,"" Kahan said. He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNPstemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag onsecond quarter growth. If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could easeback to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said. "

Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduledmeeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Councilto consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pactwith the U.S. That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations,calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world marketsand to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors. Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to liveup to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action. Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage thepact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting outJapan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output. In his letter, the contents of which were released today,Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of Marchshowed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate pricesin Asian markets.

0,"Emery Air Freight Corp topped aleveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offermay surface. Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 overEmery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per shareor 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc. Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer forPurolator exceeded their expectations. Several analysts previously had said they saw takeovervalues for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per sharerange. At least one, however, estimated the company could betaken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share. Analysts today would not venture to say whether anotheroffer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to thebelief that the bidding could go higher. ""They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer.Emery has shown the courage to go forth,"" said one arbitrager,who speculated other courier companies may also emerge asbidders. ""It makes sense,"" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey.But ""It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a100 pct of the synergies."" Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings inthe short term, but long term, after eliminating redundanciesand selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery'sprofitability. Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rivalUnited Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. packagedelivery company after Federal Express Corp &lt;FDX>, which has 47pct of the market. Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator wouldhave about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr deliverybusiness. ""This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight(delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,""said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co. Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, andits chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call. E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer,but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period onits offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST. One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likelyHutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical acompany outside the package delivery industry would want tooutbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company. Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by someof its management and the E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH> subsidiary,speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come. The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolatorboard member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said hebelieved a better offer could be made by another entity. A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director hadno contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers linedup for Purolator. Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into questionby a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attemptedto stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth.Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday. Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer couldbe bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning tokeep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279mln dlr ""bridge"" loan that would later be replaced with otherdebt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator. Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk nits investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its279 mln dlr loan. Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mlndlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs inrevenues. "
5,"The Bank of Japan is satisfied with theyen around its current range, a senior central bank officialtold reporters. He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Parislast month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around currentranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollarrise. Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currencystability, but it can be useful when coordinated with otherpolicies and with other central banks, he said. The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stabilitywill continue for some time, the senior bank official said, butdeclined to be more specific. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Fridaythe current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarilysatisfactory for the Japanese economy. Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, theofficial cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, acompletely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S.Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by governmentofficials seeking to talk the dollar up or down. The senior bank official said he expects Japan's grossnational product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more inthe fiscal year beginning in April. That would be littlechanged from the performance expected this year. Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, butthe external sector will have a negative impact on GNP ofnearly one percentage point, he said. He said there was virtually no room for further monetarypolicy action to boost the economy. The economy's performancein the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added. The central bank's monetary policy has already done itspart in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said.The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over thelast year and a half. Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk ofinflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said.""We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it maystill be wet,"" he added. Liquidity among private households and especially thecorporate sector has increased substantially, he said. The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stockexchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of fundsinto the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, maycontinue, he said.

4,"The Federal Reserve's move to easiermonetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount ratecuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in thesecond quarter, analysts said. A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates toedge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending ratefrom 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy. ""The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further withouta full-blown recession,"" said Raymond Stone, chief financialeconomist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Stone said economic data available by late June may be justweak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he saidit may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual halfpoint, to avoid hurting the dollar further. All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open MarketCommittee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged. The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughlyquarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasurybond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at whichbanks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the primelending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct. Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly tothe April-June quarter, follow: - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct furtheragainst other major currencies because of a large U.S. budgetdeficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted afterthe dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, theeconomists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is thatthe dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect. - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continuetrading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could welltest the lower end of that range. - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter andprobably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strongforeign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. Theoutlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the yearsince both inflation and interest rates may be edging up. - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflatorwill rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. Thesharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as willa mild economic pickup in the second half of this year. - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pctannual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand atrespective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 firstand second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pctannualrate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International seesboth the strongest economy and the highest interest rates amongthose surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pctrate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate thisquarter and 3.5 pct next quarter. ""The economy will bounce back more strongly than manyexpect,"" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup ininventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quartereconomic growth, with consumer spending helping later. ""We're running out of special factors to keep the economyafloat,"" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. Hisinterest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest. Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulationhelped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that secondquarter growth could be zero or negative. Braverman said economic activity next quarter will sufferfrom a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow government spending and less construction. Only a marginallynarrower trade deficit will add to growth. He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,respectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct forbonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate. Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildlyafter the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in pastdays and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan. David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Incraised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct. Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, liftedhis forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a pointto eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho andResler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct. The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japaneseinvestors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fearabout further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.trade sanctions.

5,"The Bank of France intervened to buysmall amounts of dollars and sell yen in Paris today tostabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month's meeting ofFinance Ministers of the Group of Five and Canada, foreignexchange dealers said. But they said recent central bank intervention in theforeign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction totemporary pressures rather than a major defence operation. A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sourcesclose to the central bank said it had also intervenedyesterday. Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert withthe Bundesbank and Bank of Japan. The sources said the French central bank could have been inthe market again today in two-way operations, not necessarilyon its own account, but to counter short-term pressures arisingfrom the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31. One major French bank said it bought between five and 15mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to thedollar. Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of Franceto say it was in the market, a departure from the centralbank's usual insistence on confidentiality. But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention,which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale. ""Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you wouldstill be talking of a small overall amount,"" said one dealer. Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly tohave been required to meet year-end window dressing demand foryen. ""This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than awider trend,"" the dealer said. Operators have been extremely cautious about testing thedollar's trading ranges against the West German mark andJapanese yen. These ranges were set in February's stabilisation agreementreached here by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and theFinance Ministers of Japan, Germany, France, Britain andCanada. But speculative pressures started to build again this weekafter Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend asrepeating earlier statements that Washington had no target forthe dollar. Baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talkingthe dollar down, telling a Cable News Network interviewer and aSenate committee he stood by the Paris agreement.

""The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessencompetition or to be inconsistent with the public interest,"" theDOT said in a statement. AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is aunit of AMR Corp. The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger planFeb. 20. American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms ofrevenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively smallcarrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is thenation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would notalter American's third-place ranking, according to datacompiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine. The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said. The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantiallyreduce competition on the four routes on which both carriersprovide either nonstop or single-plane service. At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOTsaid it found no evidence that other carriers could notincrease or begin service that competed with a mergedAmerican-AirCal.

4,"Federal Reserve data released todayindicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeksand that none is likely at next week's Federal Open MarketCommittee (FOMC) meeting, economists said. ""The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision ofreserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift sincethe beginning of this year,"" said Harold Nathan, economist atWells Fargo Bank. ""These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will notchange policy,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. ""The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There's no realreason for it to change policy,"" said Joseph Liro of S.G.Warburg and Co Inc. Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and doesnot require immediate policy easing and the money aggregatesmay well end March at the bottom of their target ranges. All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concernnow is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week washeavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurtingthe dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in loweringinterest rates further. Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line withexpectations and similar to the data for most of this year. The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mlndlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesdayversus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period. In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at thediscount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrscompared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statementperiod. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to6.14 pct from 6.08 pct. The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesdayand Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the datareleased today suggest it had no real need to add reserves. The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of anypressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire toboost borrowings in the second week of the statement period tomeet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg. Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-weekborrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actuallyaveraged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and thatwas up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period. Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming fortwo-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mlndlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate ofaround 6.10 pct. It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowingstarget since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, saidWells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead onthe funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to6-1/4 pct band. Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding needare anticipated for the statement period that began today. More Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to fourbillion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liroputs the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs. To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed toadd permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering tobuy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similarcoupon ""pass"" may be required later. There will be a greater demand for funds in this statementperiod because it includes the close of the quarter. Furtherupward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from windowdressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31. "

7,"Ministers from more than 20nations were told by New Zealand that the next internationalnegotiations on liberalising trade would be the last thiscentury and the cost of failure could not be measured.

""We live in troubled and dangerous times for the worldtrading system,"" he said. ""We have seen that the failure of the world trading systemhas caused great depression and conflict in the past. Ourfailure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to usall,"" Moore said. He added: ""The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It isour last hope and best opportunity this century. We will notget another chance before the year 2000."" The ministers are in New Zealand to review world tradesince the ""Uruguay round"" talks last Sepember. The meeting isalso part of preparations for a full-scale conference of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice inJune. The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to havebeen particularly successful, with northern hemispherecountries managing to have service industries such as bankingand insurance included in the next full round. The southerners' goal of including agricultural andtropical products also was met. The meeting at this North Island tourist resort isdescribed by participants as informal and no declaration isexpected. Moore said one aim was to ""instil a sense of politicalurgency to avert potential economic tragedy."" Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade topeople who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see thebenefits, as well as preventing ""bush fires of confrontationwhile we proceed with orderly negotiations."" The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegationsincluding representatives of GATT and the Economic Community. The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter. American sources say he is ready to state that the best wayto reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is toimplement four key Uruguay proposals: -- an end to agricultural subsidies; -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATTregulations; -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-calledintellectual property such as trademarks, patents andcopyrights; -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92member states.

4,"The Bank of England again fought againstmoney and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest ratecut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further risein its trade-weighted index to a six-month high. It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pctof its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continuedto buy into a currency which offers high relative returns andthe possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said. Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank canstop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should wantto. The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wantsrates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, whenit lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct torelieve a money market shortage. ""They're really making the discount houses suffer,"" saidStephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.""Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates."" This money market signal was apparently not accompanied byany sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which hadinhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers camestrongly into the pound. The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the Londonclose, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60marks, up from 2.8720/50. ""If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility thatrates could drop before the Budget,"" said Jeremy Hale, economistat finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in thebase rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow. However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to beconvinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-ratingrather than a result of short-term speculative gains. There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, saidPeter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances ofa Conservative Party victory in any early general election, anddisappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides tohold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setbackfor bonds, Fellner said. An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but mostforecasts say it will be this year. Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable tooil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar. However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to setthe timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether. The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainablerate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there. Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at leasta proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-termcapital coming into the London market, notably from Japan. They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer betthan the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls andcurrent political upheavals in Washington. The Bank may want to see another few points on thetrade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. ""But bythen sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank ofEngland,"" he added. The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resistingpressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sourcessaid the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as morethan just marking up by foreign exchange traders. Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentiallyharmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing thatthe current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg. This was above previous estimates of the current accountdeficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985. Fellner said that under more normal conditions this wouldhave given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that theywere too bullish to worry about such fundamentals. The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearingbanks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bankofficials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for thisweek, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-pointcut, with another half or full point about Budget day.

1,"A White House-ordered report said that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000could have potentially damaging implications for nationalsecurity. The Energy Department study discusses several options tocurb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations. President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruledout a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to helpthe depressed domestic oil industry. Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that""although we have made gains in energy security in the last sixyears, this report shows that there is justification fornational concern both over declining competitiveness of ourdomestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."" The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct. Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreignoil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration. President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing adetermination that the country never again become captive to aforeign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages andsharp prices increases of the 1970s. The report said an import fee would raise prices and helpmake it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce newoil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax woulddepress the nation's economy.

Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will berequired to show such a certificate, but those without it willnot automatically be denied licences, he said. But some industry officials predicted any governmentmeasures were likely to have limited effect as long as theworld semiconductor market remained weak. U.S. Government and industry officials have complainedrepeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at belowcost to third countries despite the July agreement. Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow ofcheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales bythird-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap betweenlow prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costsand set for Japanese makers under the agreement. The MITI spokesman said, ""If the percentage of grey marketis increasing for one specific company, it suggests they aredistributing their products through their sales network knowingthey will be exported by some means. In that case we will askthem what they are doing to reduce the figure."" MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.

The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividendto 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capitalfrom 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.

Foreigncurrency business last year accounted for some 37 pct ofbalance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985. Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign businesschiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which iseffectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wipedsome 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total. Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits fromthe bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but saidthat it came close to one mln stg. On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pctto 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.

2,"Sports carmaker Dr. Ing. H.C.F.Porsche AG &lt;PSHG.F> said it expects to post a satisfactoryprofit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower butU.S. Sales anticipated higher. Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic saleswere expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000from 28,670 last year. Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Lastmonth the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86. For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume thisyear to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254,Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit werebased on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, headded. The expected drop in West German sales this year would bethe result of the so-called ""grey market"" for Porsche cars, hesaid. When the dollar was strong against the mark, manyPorsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegalexport to the U.S. Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period. The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a largerpercentage of overall sales this year than before does not poseproblems for profit, the Porsche board said. In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same timePorsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki. Branitzki put Porsche's hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mlnmarks. In a speech to the annual meeting, Schutz said third-partyorders placed with Porsche's engineering research centre inWeissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year forthe first time.

1,"OPEC believes world oil prices shouldbe set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPECAssistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today. In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminarin Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: ""OPEC believes...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictionsand should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs."" But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level hadcaused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced tocurtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPECstates could not be sustained in some cases. ""For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is nowconsidered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its membercountries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailingproduction,"" Al-Wattari said. ""Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,""Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures,some states depended on associated gas output for domestic useand oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added. Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below theorganization's agreed ceiling for all member countries inFebruary, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability,though restored to a good level, was still under pressure,Al-Wattari said. ""A lasting stability in the world marketrequires a wider scope of international cooperation,"" he added. He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown apolitical willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC. But although cutbacks announced by these states werepolitically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they wereinsufficient in terms of volume, he added. ""The overall majorityof non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC'scalls for supply regulation,"" he said. Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as itallowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC tocontinue, while not generating excessive cash flow forotherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a pricewould no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added. Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, alsoaddressing the seminar, added that discipline was still neededto prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market. Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageousfor both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperationwould ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue. "

The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha Woong-Bae'sstand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrialnations to revalue the won underlined the government'sdetermination to stand firm. Rha told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ""Demands that Koreacarry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or10 pct are, I believe, extremely ill-advised."" Deputy prime minister Kim Mahn-Je told a meeting of localbusinessmen ""The government's policy on the question ofrevaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position."" Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise thewon's value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at44.5 billion dlrs at the end of 1986. Six industrialised nations agreed in Paris last month thatnewly industrialising countries, such as South Korea andTaiwan, should allow their currencies to appreciate. But local businessmen have said won/dollar parity hasalready reached ""a crisis level."" An official of the Korea Traders' Association (KTA) said ifthe won strengthened another five pct, this would mean the lossof profitability for nearly half of all South Korean exporters. ""We are determined not to go the way of Latin Americandebtor nations which have suspended interest payments of theirdebts,"" the spokesman said. ""The only way to keep our good recordis to maintain our exports.+ The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue thewon suddenly Korea would run ""a tremendous trade deficit andcould degenerate into a country, like many other developingcountries, which is reneging on its international obligations."" The spokesman said South Korea had been graduallyappreciating its currency, ruling out a major revaluation. Sofar this year, the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against thedollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986. He said South Korea was selecting ""many"" of 122 items onwhich Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to helpnarrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details weregiven. Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158items, including sensitive agricultural products and largecars, effective from July. South Korea posted its first ever current account surpluslast year, due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1billion dlrs, against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985. It earlierforecast that its current account surplus could reach eightbillion dlrs this year.

5,"The dollar is expected to decline furtherin coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness oflast month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates,senior foreign exchange dealers said. Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealerssaid they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down.Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month'saccord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing thedollar down, the dealers said. ""The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakerthat the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for majorcurrencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,"" said KojiKidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasurydivision. He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention ofintervening to support the currency. ""This eliminated the widespread market caution againstpossible joint central bank intervention,"" Kidokoro said. Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downwardmomentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardlycontain a further slide in the currency. They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers,and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollarsthrough the U.S. Central bank in New York. Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reservewould intervene on its own account to support the dollar, butsome said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148yen. ""If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce theflow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which theAmericans don't want,"" said Haruya Uehara, chief money marketmanager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next monthwhen corporations reduce their dollar sales after they closetheir books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31. But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollarremained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance ofthe U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit andJapanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package. ""The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia instimulating its economy,"" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistantgeneral manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's internationaltreasury division. In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package ofeconomic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, toboost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce itstrade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate onthe budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott ofparliamentary business over the proposed introduction of asales tax. In the circumstances the government had only a slim chanceof producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said. Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate theJapanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congresswould grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar. "

2,"Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in astatement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite afall in turnover due to lower foreign sales. The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar andother currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressureon selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices ofcrude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale ofpolystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands. World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01billion from 42.72 billion. Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billionmarks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct. The statement made no mention of net profit figures.Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23. In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by thecold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continuesat present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below theprevious year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from1986, Hoechst said. Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and informationtechnology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell. Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance ofthe parent company, other units in West Germany, and to&lt;American Hoechst Corp>. Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected therestructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities. Roussel Uclaf &lt;RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidatedpartners did not perform as well as in 1985. Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretaxprofits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earningsfrom interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall inextraordinary costs. The fall in raw material prices was not enough tocompensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices andcurrencies, Hoechst said. The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in newprojects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capitalincrease of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with theacquisition of &lt;Celanese Corp>.

2,"Ultramar Plc &lt;UMAR.L> said that whileits fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational pointof view, several special charges adversely affected results. Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstreamoperations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices anddownstream operations also affected in the first half by largelosses on inventories. But margins improved in the second half and in particularrefining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a goodrecovery. The company was commenting on results that showed a netloss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in1985. The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stgprovision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialledby Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquidnatural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownershipof Gulf Canada's marketing assets. Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of afurther reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by awithdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling itsU.S. Flag shipping operation. The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertainalthough it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increasein the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimisticprices would strengthen over the longer term. Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas putit in a good position to benefit from any price recovery. In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improveprofitability by selling or restructuring weak operations whilestrengthening core businesses and developing a soundoperational and financial base. Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalledabout 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis. Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from181p at last night's close. "

A decline in U.S. Transatlantic traffic following terroristattacks in Europe, the U.S. Bombing of the Libya, the Chernobyldisaster and a slump in the oil industry which affected MiddleEast traffic were the main causes of the loss, Thomson said.

The offer would be made through its &lt;BP North America Inc>unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. Theoffer would not be conditional on any minimum number of sharesbeing tendered. BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was basedon its own valuation as well as those of its financialadvisers. It took into account reviews of both public andnon-public information. Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down1-3/4 dlrs. BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p atlast night's close. About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP'sown resources. The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly frombanks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility andpartly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. Thecompany said it was in the course of arranging thesefacilities. BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group'sinvestment in Standard was its largest single asset. Fullownership would enable investment and operating decisions to bemade without the limitations of a minority interest. BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimumuse of its financial resources. It was confident oil priceswere likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify theinvestment. Walters added that it also felt that, due to managementchanges in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully evenin a lower oil price environment. Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrsand in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs beforetax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs. Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.One noted that it was not immediately clear why the groupshould spend so much money buying a company it alreadycontrolled. BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standardshares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago. It was also unclear what effect the tender would have onthe U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended todispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the1987/88 financial year, analysts said. Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson notedthat any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP woulddepend on the reaction of the markets. The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59pct from 20 pct currently, he said. However, with the likelihood that oil prices would notrepeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standardreturning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting fromits cash flow -- were good. Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted. Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel tomake money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue fromproduction and its downstream activities would push itcomfortably into surplus. BP initially took a stake in Standard following thediscovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP hadinadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crudeoil. The analysts said that BP had promoted a major managementreorganisation of Standard in the past year. The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard wasnow complete was one possible factor behind the timing of thetender offer, Spedding said. BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as majorbalance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been wellreceived in the markets. The lower costs that should now be possible -- especiallyafter the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to comestraight through to 1987 profits without being cut back byother sectors.

Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a16.5 mln debit previously. A company spokesman said thisrepresented additional provisions for the cost ofrationalisation plans announced in earlier years. Rowntree expects North American operations will this year,ahead of company expectations, be of the same order as thosefrom the U.K. And the rest of Europe combined, the statementsaid. A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast. Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide,including further moves in the speciality retailing businesswhich Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said. Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast bychairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performanceof seven businesses bought last year was encouraging. The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share andincreased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concernincreased profit and Rowntree's small health food business,Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said. Offsetting factors included currency movements, which costthe company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profitson confectionery operations, and the company faced strongcompetition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets. "

Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mlnin February, 1986, because of lower prices, he added. Fendt said although the February results were lower thanthe average expected for the rest of the year, the government'starget of an eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should beachieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9.5 billiondlrs. Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrsand imports 14.5 billion, he added.

Fendt said imports were running at levels well above thetraditional average for Brazil. Imports in the first two months of the year, excluding oiland wheat, totalled 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion inthe same 1986 period. This rise reflected industry's need for equipment to raiseproduction and is perfectly compatible with the government'sprogram for economic growth, Fendt added. "

At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade andIndustry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calmU.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practicesin semiconductors. Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduledmeeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Councilto consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pactwith the U.S. That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations,calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world marketsand to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.

2,"Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlierreporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlierprofit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to writedowns totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction indeferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs. The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreignexchange losses, the company said. ""The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reversesmuch of the progress the company has made in the two previousyears,"" Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement. ""But even a net loss of this magnitude has very littlebearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome,"" chairmanMacdonald said. ""It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of thecompany's assets in today's economic environment, and theabsolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenderson a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continuedexistence,"" he added. Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan forrestructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs. Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulatedforeign exchange losses to current expenses because of theuncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan. Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remainingperiod of the loans to which they apply, it said. Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarterreduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to acharge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly inthe third quarter. Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter chargeresulted from a year-end accounting change made under new fullcost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute ofChartered Accountants. The company said it previously determined a write down ofconventional oil and gas properties was not required atSeptember 30, under the previous method of calculating thelimitation of oil and gas values. Dome said the most significant accounting change under thenew guidelines is using current oil and gas prices incalculations instead of escalating price forecasts. Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan precludethe company from making an accurate estimate of futurefinancing costs, which are used in the new accountingcalculations, it said. As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantiallyconform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securitiesand Exchange Commission, the company said. Dome said operating income from its crude oil and naturalgas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs. Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gasoperating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billiondlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue. Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization ofDome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea alsocontributed to the decline, it said. Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985. Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs. Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintainedat prior year's levels through new drilling activity andimprovements in productivity. Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result oflower domestic and export sales, it said. Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year. Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a dayfrom 591.0 mcf a day. "

0,"A bidding war for Viacom InternationalInc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted amanagement group and other investors against NationalAmusements Inc, a closely held theater operator. Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A sourceclose to the management side insisted that timing was on hisside. He said if outside directors approve the managementproposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholderswith proxy material going out late this week. ""It would take 20days from the day we mail,"" said the source. The source predicted National Amusements, controlled byinvestor Sumner Redstone, would need ""half a year"" to completea tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that mustaccompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licensesand cable television franchises. Redstone was not available for comment. Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a raresituation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. Onesaid Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted andif enough people were convinced his proposal was superior tothe Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win. The independent directors of Viacom were called into ameeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow. Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. Onemajor Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. ""We thinkwe're at the end now, in terms of bidding,"" said the firm'sarbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified. Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal wouldcreate a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. Themanagement plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferredstock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock. Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with avalue of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stockstock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equityinterest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculatedthe equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making thetotal package worth 52 dlrs per share. Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeablepreferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share ofconvertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portionwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs. Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest hewould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyondApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. Theplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pctduring May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offeredeight pct interest. Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the managementgroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,were offering high prices. ""Redstone really wants to own thecompany,"" one said. Another said management seemed to have theedge on the timing issue. Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares. A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine whatthe equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. Henoted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp <FMC>, whichadopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititallytraded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is nowjust over 30 dlrs. Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell twotwo cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costsfrom several acquisitions affected results. Shares of Warner Communications Inc <WCI> rose 7/8 to31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at37.50 dlrs. Chris Craft Industries <CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner,rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.

The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan totake into account the potential harm to U.S. agriculturalexports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreignunfair trade practices against other domestic industries. The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seekgovernment monitoring of imports if there is a reasonablechance the industry would be harmed by an import surge. The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the billnext week and congressional sources said they expect it will beapproved.  In investigations involving a processed agriculturalproduct, trade associations of processors or producers wouldhave to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfairduties.  The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives forthe Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture,seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import andexport practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas andnon-tariff barriers.  President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATTagreement would be extended through January 1993 and authorityto negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extendedthrough January 3, 1991.

The bureau channels funds to government financialinstitutions for public works and other official uses, theysaid. The base lending rate for state bodies such as the JapanDevelopment Bank, People's Finance Corp and the financecorporations of local public enterprises usually moves intandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said. However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust FundBureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.

On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cuttheir prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositorsusing the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts andTelecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity ofthe Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.

4,"Latest Federal Reserve data suggestthat the U.S. banking system is flush with reserves going intoa period of traditional tightness and that overall monetarypolicy is on hold, economists said. ""There is ample liquidity.... The Fed is not going to shiftgears at the present time or for at least another month,"" saidMaria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ""Technical and seasonal considerations aside, there isnothing for the (credit) market to get excited about,"" addedRobert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc. Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount windowaveraged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bankstatement period ending next Wednesday, compared with 233 mlnand 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods. Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revisionin banks' net free reserves in the two-week period to March 11to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln. Finally, a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14money center banks were absent from the Fed's discount windowfor the third week running, with the latest week's borrowingsplit between the large regional and the smaller banks. While modest open market intervention was apparently enoughto defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the lateststatement period, economists predicted that the Fed would haveto be more aggressive in coming weeks. The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectlyon four of the five trading days via system and customerrepurchase agreements. ""Fed funds will be coming under relatively intensepressure,"" said Salomon's di Clemente, noting the approachingmonth- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax datesin April. ""The Fed is faced with a large seasonal addingrequirement,"" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc,who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a couponpurchase in early April. Economists were also heartened by further signs of adeceleration in money supply growth, not only in the largelydiscredited M-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M-2and M-3 aggregates. M-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine,compared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. WeeklyM-2 and M-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth. ""The M-1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect weare on our way to another moderate set of M-2 and M-3 figuresfor March,"" said Salomon's di Clemente. Merrill's McCarthy saidthey could even come in below the bottom of their respectivetarget ranges. In February, M-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upperlimit and M-3 was 20.8 billion beneath. Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson's encouraging remarks oninflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas, someeconomists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lendsupport to calls for further accommodation here. ""Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards inrates before anything else,"" said Salomon's di Clemente, addingthat the key swing factor will continue to be the strength ofthe U.S. economy. Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy'shealth would remain the main influence on policy but, contraryto di Clemente, he said that recent signs of faster growth andinflation could lead to higher rates first. Drexel's Ramirez did not commit herself either way, addingthat the next major move may have to wait until April 14 whenFebruary's U.S. trade data are due for release. "

2,"State-owned engine maker &lt;Rolls RoycePlc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow withmany analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it islikely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;AirbusIndustrie> A340 aircraft. The company's so-called ""pathfinder prospectus"" gives all thedetails of its stock market flotation except for the price atwhich shares will be offered. Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rosein 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before. Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profitfor 1987. Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profitsand a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rollsoperated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings. Assuming the company was valued at around eight timesearnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of theaerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards. BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between1.5 billion and 1.7 billion. The price will be increased by it being likely to have muchof its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure thecompany's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls wasrescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971. When the government announced the sale, it said it wouldinject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company. Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a creditrating to match those of its main competitors such as GeneralElectric Co &lt;GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N> Prattand Whitney unit.

0,"Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlrpurchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Incbrokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurersare likely to follow, securities analysts said. The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage housesis likely to pay off in dollars and international marketposition, they said. ""It's part of a trend towards growingcapital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreignfinancial institutions,"" said Simon Smithson, an analyst withKleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm describedby some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will giveNippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions onWall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of itsassets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in businesssectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory assetmanagement, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and theworld's biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve thedeal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese lifeinsurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japaneseinsurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocksand sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets andinstruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official wasappointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co'sboard and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become alimited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co. Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller andproblem-plagued banks in 1984. ""But now Japanese are going forblue-chip organisations,"" he said. ""It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturingindustries,"" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. ""With ahistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan."" Competition in fund management has grown along with greaterJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mlnyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17to 18 pct, he said. To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas andgain experience with financial instruments which are likely tospread to Japan with further deregulation. ""The high regulatoryenvironment has delayed (life insurance firms')diversification. Now there's a growing number of new productsin an environment of increasing competition for performance onfund management,"" Smithson said. "
2,"BASF AG saidthe volatile currency situation last year, particularly thefall of the dollar, led to sharp drops in turnover denominatedin marks and to price reductions for exports from domesticproduction. But in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the groupsaid it expected satisfactory business development over thenext months. ""At the moment we do not expect any extraordinaryinfluences such as there were last year,"" it said. Orders inhand and incoming orders were steady at a high level. BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-taxprofit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985. The unusual situation on the crude oil market last yearalso produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector andforced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said. The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses onstocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. Inthe parent company, the positive earnings developmentcontinued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover wasbalanced out by increased capacity use and price declines inraw materials.  In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47billion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell8.5 pct to 18.72 billion.

Results from these had been taken only partly into thefourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data.

Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oilengineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations toattempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several yearsto keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong. ""Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concertedeffort by the Saudis to get production down,"" Wellemeyer said. ""The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs abarrel) and are willing to make it happen again,"" he said. In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs abarrel level on market reports of some OPE members producingabove their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mlnbarrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on abelief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.

1,"The council of theAustralian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said itwill press on with its campaign for major improvements toAustralia's petroleum taxation structure. The council said in a statement the industry was bitterlydisappointed by the Australian government's position ontaxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and EnergyMinister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference. As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to targetany tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach tosecondary taxation of petroleum. APEA had expected the government to make positive responsesto detailed industry submissions seeking the removal ofexisting secondary tax disincentives to exploration anddevelopment, the council said. It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised byEvans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceedwith the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation. Evans told the conference the government did not plan toaccept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allowdeductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure. ""The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction ofunsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshorearea in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax isprofit based,"" the APEA council said. The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oilexploration companies that it had realistic answers to theindustry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry'sproblems, the council said. The industry has called for the end of all discriminatorysecondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as majordisincentives at a time of low oil prices. "

7,"House trade lawmakers took theirfirst votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws butheld over until tomorrow the most difficult votes oncontroversial plans to protect American industries. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means TradeSubcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issuesin the bill--whether they will force major foreign tradingpartners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the UnitedStates. The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version ofDemocratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to openforeign markets but which drops last year's effort to forcePresident Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs. Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said thelawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and willconsider a proposal to mandate retaliation without settingspecific trade penalties. The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways andMeans Committee next week before the full House votes on it. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seekinghis party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer anamendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses ofthose countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods. This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan toforce a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surpluswith the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, WestGermany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances. ""My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard forgetting the trade deficit down,"" he told reporters. The trade law changes are to become part of a majorcongressional and administration effort to turn around therecord U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year byopening up foreign markets and making U.S. products morecompetitive. House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said againtoday he expects the full House will approve the trade bill byMay and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill. ""I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and MeansCommittee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effectivebill,"" he told reporters. The comprehensive trade bill will include work by othercommittees to ease export controls on high technology, to aidU.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulateresearch and development, to remove foreign trade barriers andto improve education and worker training. The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S.industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competitionif they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining,safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to thecountry's economic development. They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether toretaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules andwhether an injured industry deserves import relief. They agreed to make it easier for a company to gettemporary relief from import competition but agreed theindustry should provide a plan to become competitive. The administration has not announced its support butYeutter said yesterday, ""I am cautiously optimistic,"" that theDemocratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill. "

The company said that this was despite the mark's furtherstrengthening against the dollar and other currencies anddespite an increase in competitive pressure. ""The further progress of our business will depend largely onthe extent to which threats to free trade materialise and onthe developments of exchange rates, raw material and energycosts. Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billionmarks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72billion from 1.62 billion. The company gave no net profit figures or any indication ofthe likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985results, up one mark from a year earlier. Bayer said that world group operating profit declinedslightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showeda further improvement. Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainlythe sharp fall in the dollar against the mark. Lower prices on the raw material side had also broughtpressure on selling prices, it added. In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against1985, the company said without giving details. ""The western Europe, North America and Far East regionsdeveloped well in local currency, but here too the translationof local currency sales into marks distorted the picture,especially in the case of North America,"" it said. Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks. Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986,resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combinedwith savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offsetfalling prices and cost increases in other areas. The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lowerextraordinary expenses and higher net interest income.Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating rawmaterials all developed well, it said. Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that worldgroup turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last threemonths of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period. Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pctto 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower andforeign turnover 8.6 pct lower.

2,"Dutch dairy and general foodsmanufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV &lt;WESS.AS>, said it isplanning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strongprofit growth over the next 10 years.  Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at thepresentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987first quarter profits to show an increase. The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985. This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar'sguilder value, van Driel said. Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guildershigher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985level of 3.20 guilders. Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mlnguilders down because of the lower dollar and lower rawmaterial prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders. US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover,compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separatebusinesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide. Van Driel said the company would continue an activetakeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying morethan its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit. He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisitionpossibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China. He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mlnguilders and would if necessary make new share issues. Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mlndlrs. He said &lt;Balanced Foods> and &lt;Green's Dairy>, taken overlate last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrswhich was not included in the 1986 account. All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key tothis growth was the successful introduction of new products,which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented USacquisitions, van Driel said. Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said. The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich,Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims tobe quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said. Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not beaccompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehiclesfor the company to raise capital for future expansion. He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were inforeign hands. The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made alisting on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step,van Driel said without elaborating. Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which producesaround 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospectsfor its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said. "

4,"West German commercial banks arecautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, bankingsources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after theBundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than theusual interim period. A Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cuttingleading savings rate for private customers on a regional basisby 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F>and Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bankfuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG &lt;BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally. The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire togauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savingsbanks. A fall in customer savings because of lower rates couldreduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them todraw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, oneeconomist at the German Banking Association said. But the volume of savings funds may not be substantiallyundercut by lower savings rates because many customers areparking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvestthem at higher yields in the future, he said. He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move morefunds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-datedsecurities to reduce strong growth in its central bank moneysupply aggregate. The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside theexpanded target range of three to six pct. Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to privatecustomers, though lending rates for corporate customers arebeginning to decline. "

In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations,the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimouslyMonday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 millionU.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry. ""We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure thatCanadian interests are well protected,"" Clark told the House ofCommons in the daily question period. But he said the opposition parties should be careful ""notto raise false alarms too early."" The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department'strade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potashproducers from New Mexico, claiming unfair governmentsubsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments. Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a thirdgoing to the U.S. Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer,comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan. In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded theruling as just another ""trade harrassment"" from the U.S. andcriticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would beprotected.

Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressedconfidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problemstems from low international commodity prices and notgovernment subsidies.

""The company believes that in order to address itslong-term needs and return to a satisfactory level ofoperations, it will ultimately need several hundred milliondollars of additional capital, or a combination with a morestrongly capitalized entity,"" First City said in a note to itsfinancial statements included in the annual report.

But many saidthey did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices inthe industry, simply because of the competition the phoneindustry giant faces. ""You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,""said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. ""But you wouldn'tsee a rise."" Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT toselectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. ""Itwill give ATT a lot more flexibility,"" he said. ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number ofcompanies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCChearings. It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, thelong distance joint venture between GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and UnitedTelecommunications Inc &lt;UT>. ""We think the Congress of the FCC should establish areasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it,"" a U.S.Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposedto greater competition. It may also take some time for the proposals to go through,and in the process they may be altered by the variousconstituencies affected by the move. ""There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so muchbureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, itwon't happen that fast,"" said analyst Victor Krueger of theGartner Group. "
1,"Drilling for oil in California islikely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levelsdespite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analystssaid. Because much of the crude oil in California fields isthick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have toincrease to near 1985's levels before any significant recoveryis seen in drilling, they said. ""Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,""said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, comparedto about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger OilInformation Services, which tracks California drillingactivity. ""It's in the dregs right now,"" said Bolster of the state'sdrilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increaseddrilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California IndependentProducers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pactto curb production boosted oil prices early this year, priceseventually fell. Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, haveslumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a highof about 17 dlrs. More than half of California's oil comes from stripperwells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and thatmuch of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel toextract, Malmgreen said. ""It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,""Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coastproduce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inlandwells frequently require the use of steam injection to spurextraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is cloudedby a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, whichproduces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratorydrilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell ofthe state energy commission. So far this year only fiveexploratory wells have been drilled. ""I don't think they'll even get to what they did lastyear,"" Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest ofthe decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in thenumber of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number ofproducing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 frommore than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California EnergyCommission. In line with that decrease, California's crude oil outputfell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and isexpected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California's crude oilproduction slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrelsper day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department ofConservation. ""Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,""Guerard said. "
0,"Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressurefrom one of its largest creditors, &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank ofCommerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,energy industry analysts said. Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security forpart of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock topay down debt, analysts said. ""The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in thedirection that might make it a saleable asset,"" said one analystwho asked not to be named. Dome earlier said it was not considering selling EncorEnergy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest inCanadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> is up for sale ""atthe right price."" Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment thatit does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. TheEncor shares do not pay dividends. A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when askedwhether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake. At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would bevalued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Minesshares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs. Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may alsoprompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in theCanadian oil and gas producer, analysts said. ""Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially inrecent weeks with a runup in crude prices,"" Peters and Co Ltdoil analyst Wilf Gobert commented. ""The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see itsold at these levels because they can get more for it now thanthey have been able to in recent years,"" he added. Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around sixdlrs in early February. The company also recently set up its own operatingmanagement, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented. Dome and Encor ""are actually going to get farther apart. So(the sale) does make a lot of sense,"" Mote said. However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divestEncor in favor of retaining the operating assets since saleproceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt toCommerce Bank. ""I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long asthey can,"" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber. Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move toblock such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets. ""Other creditors generally all want to make sure thatsomething they might be able to get a piece of is not beingsold out from under them,"" said analyst Gobert. Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr jointliability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by ArcticPetroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration. Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder thepossible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines. Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum'sdebt and has a ""right of consent"" to the sale of Dome Petroleum'sholding. Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shareswould seek some type of relief on the company's debtobligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said. Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at whatprice the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share ""are veryattractive.""

Pickens was not available for comment. Traders noted that activity in the stock increased todayafter a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco. Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4. Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard,Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised atmarket rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeoverattempt. ""It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and hisgroup may be interested,"" Feretti said. ""But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of itssheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes achallenge."" Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take overDallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA> last winter, has madeno secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gasreserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize soonerthan oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimatedin excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said. Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow ofabout 10 dlrs a share ""which is probably very attractive toPickens."" Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup valuewell into the 60 dlr a share range. ""I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostiletakeover,"" Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analystJohn Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors. ""Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrsin long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding."" He said thebuyer would also have to deal with ""the intractable problems""Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energybusinesses. Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number ofdefensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such asspin off some of its non-energy businesses directly toshareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnershipout of its natural gas pipeline interests. An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouragedthe Pickens rumor. ""Pickens has a plateful already with hisholdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess,"" he said. ""Idon't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problemswith Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losingabout 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billiondlrs on the market today.""

A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies ABInvestor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had takenover an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match. Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier <NOBL ST>, in whichPenser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the marketprice for the Swedish Match option, the statement said. Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased votingrights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 forthe free shares. The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capitalwhile Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rightsand 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match. The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previouslyamounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company. The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the mostexpensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four yearsto defend its far-flung interests from outside predators. The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an armsand chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo<VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco<ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs <SKPS ST>. Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largestshareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB <SKBS ST> andFrederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.

2,"Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> managementboard chairman Walter Seipp said that from the presentviewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to belower than in 1986. In the first two months of the year, partial operatingprofit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account -declined, he said, without giving details. The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of thequiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly.By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased. German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seippsaid last year the figure for the first time had topped onebillion marks for the parent bank, and the group result wasaround 50 pct higher than this. Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, ""we were able to raise thefull operating profit...Slightly above the record result of1985 because own account profits increased slightly."" He gave no concrete details but added that in January andFebruary, good own account trading profits meant that the dropin full operating earnings was more modest than that in thepartial operating figure. The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented infuture, developing, for example, more into investment banking,keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampeningexpenditures on fixed assets. Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there hadbeen a strong growth in business volume. Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added. Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15billion. It would have been around five billion marks higherstill if currency relationships had remained unchanged. In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct inthe year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56pct despite pressure on credit rates. The surplus on commission business, which had soared by aquarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almostexclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said. Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at morethan 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pctto more than 650 mln. As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit roseby 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks. Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last yearfrom 233 mln in 1985. Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a ""hightwo-figure million"" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG&lt;AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F> during the latter'smajority stake purchase booked last year. The ability of the bank to write off depreciations incredit business against profits from securities trading andearnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prioryears, to its full extent. Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far thelargest part of the provisions were set aside for individualwrite-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle ofproblem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio ofcredit exposure to provisions improved further. Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure toproblem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped intodollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks. ""This means that no open currency positions exist any longeron the amount of the provision that is made against an actualdefault,"" he added. Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in thelast few weeks, he said, the international banking community isbetter armed than it was against payment problems. All banks had significantly strengthened their capitalbase, most European banks had made considerable provisionsagainst bad debts while goverments and central banks werebetter prepared for unforseen difficulties. He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting newapproach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot ofinterest in direct investment via an equity participation inLatin America, particularly from West German firms. "

5,"The dollar is expected to decline furtherin coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness oflast month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates,senior foreign exchange dealers said. Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealerssaid they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down.Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month'saccord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing thedollar down, the dealers said. ""The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakerthat the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for majorcurrencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,"" said KojiKidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasurydivision. He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention ofintervening to support the currency. ""This eliminated the widespread market caution againstpossible joint central bank intervention,"" Kidokoro said. Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downwardmomentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardlycontain a further slide in the currency. They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers,and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollarsthrough the U.S. Central bank in New York. Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reservewould intervene on its own account to support the dollar, butsome said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148yen. ""If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce theflow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which theAmericans don't want,"" said Haruya Uehara, chief money marketmanager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next monthwhen corporations reduce their dollar sales after they closetheir books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31. But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollarremained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance ofthe U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit andJapanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package. ""The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia instimulating its economy,"" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistantgeneral manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's internationaltreasury division. In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package ofeconomic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, toboost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce itstrade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate onthe budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott ofparliamentary business over the proposed introduction of asales tax. In the circumstances the government had only a slim chanceof producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said. Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate theJapanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congresswould grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar. "

Others saidstocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughputvolumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher orlower than the week ended March 13, traders said. The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S.distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another draw reflecting historic seasonal trends. For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocksdown 2.9 mln barrels. Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels saidthey are looking for fairly high consumption rates as thespring and summer driving season gets underway this year,because retail prices are still low compared to recent years. U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrelsfor the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over theoutcome for last week because there is uncertainty aboutwhether throughput levels increased or decreased last week. Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrelshigher, while others think inventories could be as much as fivemln barrels below the previous week. The lower estimates are supported by the belief that cruderuns increased and imports fell. The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the weekended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightlyup or down for the week ended March 20. Expectations for product stockdraws are already beingreflected in firmer prices, traders said.

0,"American Express Co remained silent onmarket rumors it would spinoff all or part of its ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may beconsidering such a move because it is unhappy with the marketvalue of its stock. American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as themarket calculated a partially public Shearson may command agood market value, thereby boosting the total value of AmericanExpress. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financialservices firm would split its stock and boost its dividend. American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume. American Express would not comment on the rumors or itsstock activity. Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcementyesterday of management changes. At the meeting, company officials said American Expressstock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performanceof Shearson, according to analysts. Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chiefoperating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position ofpresident, which had been vacant. It also created four newpositions for chairmen of its operating divisions. Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make mostsense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a totalspinoff. Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff ofShearson would be good since it is a strong profit center forAmerican Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings lastyear. ""I think it is highly unlikely that American Express isgoing to sell shearson,"" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.He questioned what would be a better investment than ""a veryprofitable securities firm."" Several analysts said American Express is not in need ofcash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strongasset. But others believe the company could very well ofconsidered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and onerumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market. Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said hebelieves American Express could have considered a partialspinoff in the past. ""Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched abig premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is inthe 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place wouldprobably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of marketcapitalization,"" said Eckenfelder.

""...That does not preclude acquisitions anddivestitures along the way,"" he said. Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to thebrokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock mightbetter reflect other assets, such as the travel relatedservices business. ""It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposureto brokerage. The value of the other components could command ahigher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage ofthe total operating earnings of the company,"" he said.

There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal withthe problem quickly and ""a more common understanding of how weare going to get from here to there,"" Yeutter said. However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple ofyears of tough negotiations ahead, he said. ""It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to ploughimmense amounts of financial resources into the production ofitems that nobody wants to buy,"" he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of thefinancial resources now committed to agriculture to other moreproductive areas. This would help agriculture because some itsinefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, hesaid. Individual segments in many countries may lose in theprocess, but it should result in a more rational system ofworld-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach arelatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably morethan that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,he said.

0,"Less than two months after FirstInterstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmericaCorp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought. In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking forways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,""so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain ourindependence, if possible."" In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the majorEast Coast banks to buy banks in California. First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, andthe nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 westernstates and has franchise operations in four additional states. Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target forlarge U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region. While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, whenasked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,""That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naivenot to think that."" Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as""opportunistic"". He said he will look for banks in management trouble thathe can get at a bargain, then add management to restoreprofitability, or for banks in states where First Interstatealready operates, then cut costs by combining resources. The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said mostof the banks are already well managed, but might be purchasedat a discount because of the depressed regional economy. Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might movehim to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, ""Wecontinue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot ofpeople continue to monitor and look at us."" Banking analysts, however, consider another FirstInterstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happenany time soon. Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, ""a very,very difficult decision."" With that decision made, however, he acknowledged FirstInterstate may now have a difficult time keeping its numberfour position in the California banking community. ""The competition in this state is tough,"" he said, notingCityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branchesfrom Sears Roebuck company. ""CityBank is moving rapidly to moveus down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth,"" he said. Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that SecurityPacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regionalcompetitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated. ""Security is, has been and continues to be a highlyprofitable and obviously well managed company,"" he said. He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has theadvantages of having owned and managed regional banks longerand has the recognition advantage of having given its regionalbanks a common name. Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in goodfinancial condition, First Interstate continues to sustainserious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,real estate and agriculture dominate the economy. Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,he said, ""I don't think it has bottomed out, because I thinkmost of the problems are real estate-related and the realestate problems are going to be with us for several years."" Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture inthe Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate'sfranchise operation. First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer FirstInterstate financial services in ten states. While a year ago he was considering taking his franchiseoperation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said becausemost of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion intothe Midwest must come first. Calling the franchise system, ""moderately profitable,""Pinola said, ""It is going to take a rejuvenation of theagriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speedwe were generating before the last year or two."" On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only bankswith minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits. "

1,"A unanimous Supreme Court ruled thatoil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off theAlaska coast which were leased by the federal government toeight major oil companies. The ruling was an important victory for the oil companiesand the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasingprogram and a setback for two small Alaskan villages thatchallenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment. The administration said that the court-ordered halt indrilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paidfor 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980. A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to haltall exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts inthe Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to thesubsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos. But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong inissuing an injunction halting exploration. ""Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration wasnot at all probable,"" Justice Byron White wrote for the court.""And on the other side of the balance of harms was the factthat the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrsto exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 whichthey would have lost without chance of recovery had explorationbeen enjoined,"" he said. The oil companies, Amoco Corp &lt;AN>, ARCO, Exxon Corp &lt;XON>,Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Union Oil,had said that voiding previously granted leases would result instaggering financial losses. The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres andgenerated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs. Administration officials, saying the lease sales werepreceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied thatthe oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources. The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with anorganization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued thatthe drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing. "
0,"A Japanese businessman announced plans fora new telecommunications firm in which Britain's Cable andWireless Plc would be a core company. However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation ofEconomic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does notspecify what stake Cable and Wireless would have. ""The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,""Watanabe said in a statement. ""The actual percentage ofshareholdings should be agreed by the core companies."" He said the eight core companies will provide directors forthe firm. ""The new company shall immediately set to work on thefeasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,""Watanabe said. Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups,one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against&lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which now monopolizes Japan'soverseas telephone business. The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wantsonly one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts. A British source, who declined to be identified further,said the proposals could open the door to further talks betweenC and W &lt;CAWL.L> and the other firms involved. C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal whichwould have given it a five pct share in the newtelecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pctstake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stakein one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge. The British source said the decision not to specify theexact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the dooropen for further discussion. ""It's probably a sensible approach on their part,"" theBritish source told reuters. C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay anew cable between Japan and the U.S. The proposed merger has sparked an international row, withBritish government sources threatening retaliatory actionagainst Japan for what they see as discriminatory practicesagainst foreign firms. The sources said last Friday that one option for Britainwould be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securitiescompanies operating in London. The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans,saying that both rival consortia should be licensed. Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms,Watanabe said, ""They will not be core companies but if they wishthey could participate."" Under the Japanese law, total foreignparticipation would be limited to one-third. ""It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which hasthe support of many influential backers and work within thisfor the realization of their ideas,"" Watanabe told reporters. The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T>, Mitsuiand Co &lt;MITS.T>, Sumitomo Corp &lt;SUMT.T>, Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co &lt;MC.T>, Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T>, C Itoh and Co&lt;CITT.T>, and &lt;Pacific Telesis International Inc>.

2,"West Germany's chemicalindustry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, JosefStrenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said. Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F>,told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the maindangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar aswell as crude oil and commodity prices. Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harmingearnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at thestart of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986. The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, wasbadly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover wasmainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said. Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 andcompetition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings fromlower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by pricecompetition and increased costs. Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemicalfirms were slightly worse than the year before but the improvedfinancial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,neutralized the negative impact. Strenger said the industry would try to increase productionin the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out ofWest Germany. The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall inexports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East. Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far Eastexports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.

5,"A confidential World Bank report on thePeruvian economy has said the government's strategy does notoffer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and islikely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure. The report, published today by the economic monthly, ThePeru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia'sgovernment in stimulating output last year to achieve a growthin gross domestic product of over eight pct ""represents gains inthe short term at the expense of the long."" Government officials had no immediate comment on thereport, which advised a reduction in the overall size of thepublic investment program and greater emphasis on thepreservation of Peru's export potential. The report said that although the government had succeededin cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivationprogram was encountering rising difficulties. ""An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked tomonetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing ofprice controls, appears not improbable,"" it added. The world bank report said the government's policies hadreduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption atthe apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of thecurrency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses,and sharply diminished creditworthiness. It said unless the government took action quickly to fix acompetitive exchange rate and control the public sectordeficit, ""the higher the probability will be that the governmentwill eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment ofdomestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still furthercontrols on imports in order to stem inflation and support thebalance of payments."" It said the bank would place more emphasis on thepreservation of peru's export potential, external links andoverall economic efficiency. The government's incentive policies towards the mining andpetroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports,suggested that it did not accord high priority to theireconomic viability, it added. "

Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve tieswith institutional investors, suggesting representatives ofthose institutions be granted seats on the boards of directorsof companies they invest in. ""Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,for that is but a short step from saying that they should beprotected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,the proprietors of the company,"" Leigh-Pemberton said.

""The degree of success or failure(of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether ornot the takeover was contested,"" he said.

5,"Middle East currency dealers meet inAbu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in theirbusiness, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift fromthe Arab world to London. The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Associationalso comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulfcurrency system is more real that at any time this decade. Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said theseissues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected tobe major talking points. About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks --including some in London and other major non-Arab financialcentres -- are expected to attend the conference which beginson on Saturday. Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that agrowing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market,by far the largest in the region, is being carried out inLondon. The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks,foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks inBahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-basedbanks are boosting their treasury operations in London. As recession hit the Middle East and the need for tradefinance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrainran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island. The two major Bahrain-based international banks, &lt;ArabBanking Corp> and &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> have increasedtheir presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgradingrepresentative offices to branch status to allow dealing. One economist said: ""It is cheaper to run a riyal book inLondon than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London."" Jeddah-based &lt;Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposittaker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,&lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November1986. The major market maker has traditionally been London-basedconsortium bank &lt;Saudi International Bank> but the kingdomjoint-venture &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded itsLondon operation to deposit taker status in mid-February. One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: ""Inevitably thevolume of business in London has gained pace with the two newlicences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that mostof the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia."" Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudiriyal market is difficult to quantify. Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currencydeposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, droppedto the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion. The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyaltrading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become veryquiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks nowstaff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect&lt;Arab National Bank> to step up London operations. Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal marketmoving completely out of the region, partly because of localdemand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi ArabianMonetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderateinternationalisation of the riyal and protect it from unduespeculation. There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar marketshifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrainand London is still limited. But for the first time since the formation of the sixnation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signsthat a much mooted currency union could come into force soon. Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a finalcurrency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia,Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. But plans to link the six currencies in a European MonetarySystem style with a common peg have been discussed at highlevel and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expectedto be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year. One dealer said: ""A lot of exposure is being given todiscussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in theend a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead."" One open question is that of a common peg for currencies. The idea of linking the six currencies has been debatedsince the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currentlylinked to a basket of currencies while the other fivecurrencies are either officially or in practice linked to theU.S. Dollar. Some traders said a currency union could mean speculationagainst the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains. Another topic for debate is expected to be the continuedslide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and theundermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks. "

5,"Interest in the currency futures markethas shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentiallyexplosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continentaland Japanese currencies, analysts said. The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the pastweek-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to thedollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom. ""Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...andtechnically, the pound is in the best shape,"" PaineWebberanalyst Jason Gillard said. ""We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, andwe're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change,""Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said. Many traders took on long pound/short West German markfutures positions, although some of those cross-trades wereliquidated yesterday, Sloane said.  The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have beenrelatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimismsurrounding the British economy, analysts said. ""Money seems to be chasing yields,"" William Byers, of BearStearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate. Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in thepound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek torelieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing downinterest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17. The budget itself could have an impact, depending on howwell it is received, but analysts say relative interest ratesand oil income remain the main influences on the currency. However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K.interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cuttheir discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloanesaid. The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, butSloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon. The sideways price pattern in the June contract, withsmaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a ""bull flag"" onprice charts, technically-oriented analysts said. ""It makes for an explosive type of situation that oftenleads to a breakout,"" in this case to the upside, Sloane said. Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadiandollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recentclose at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar. ""At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-termpositive, but for the technical burden of proof you need aclose above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,"" Byers said. As to the traditionally more active currencies, stabilitywas the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts. Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs andJune German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400,respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430. Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still veryrespectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bankintervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada. ""We may still probe to see what the parameters are,"" Byerssaid, ""but people are very reluctant because they don't knowwhere the central banks will be (to intervene)."" Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous priceconsolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundlysluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer atthat level. "

A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at thefront of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out. Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside thewreck of the 7,951 ton roll-on, roll-off ferry which now liespartly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour. The ferry's owner is &lt;European Ferries Plc>, majority ownedby Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc &lt;PORL.L>. The operation to right the vessel began yesterday afterdivers abandoned their search for more bodies.

3,"The Canadian government is expectedto announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. cornexports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S.government and farm group representatives said. The deadline for a final determination is March 7. U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in asimilar case covering European pasta imports. In that case,Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of theCanadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. cornexports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market. Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. cornimports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts lastmonth because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

7,"Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-leveltrade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides aregrowing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review thewhole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the wayfor American Secretary of State George Schultz's one daystop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action toreduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said. ""We appreciate their frustration,"" a senior Japanesegovernment official said. ""But we are also frustrated."" The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slashspending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,but it will, he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progressthat has been made and instead emphasizing the problems thatremain when it talks with Congress. ""It would only take five minutes to list theiraccomplishments,"" a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on theeconomic structures of both countries and how they affect thebilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days, the topics will range frommultilateral trade talks under the auspices of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral tradeproblems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheelingdiscussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics includesavings and investment issues such as consumer credit andhousing, and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for theJapanese government, which is facing increasing domesticpressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy andstimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention ofboosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the hugeU.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the tradeimbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Isbuying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a drafttrade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserialtrade practices. ""It condemns Japan without due process,"" oneJapanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-outbill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration'strade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocalaccess to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory tradeaction by the U.S., Officials said. Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weakbargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade billoverhanging them. ""We have no leverage,"" one official admitted. As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaintsabout its trade practices in a variety of fields, includingsuper computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanesesuper computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire topublic institutions like universities which buy thesophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting upinformal bidding procedures easily understood by all potentialsellers, officials said.

3,"Soviet winter grains could be off toa faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry falland cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in theSoviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature toforecast any major crop problems, analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next sixweeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply andfuture buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said. ""From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty thatthe Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have alower crop (than last year),"" Gail Martell, chief meteorologistfor E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas willbe the crucial period that will determine the final outcome ofthe winter crops, Martell and other analysts said. ""Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead ofus,"" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectaresof winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter cropand would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, theUSDA analyst said. With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be ableto reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analystsnoted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcovercombined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has beendue to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. ""Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlationbetween mediocre crops and fall dryness,"" Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normalin southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over theentire winter crop area, she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which thesnowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, seniorforecaster for Accu Weather, said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of thefall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring wouldrequire longer off-pasture feeding, they said. ""The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... theydon't have to buy (grains) now,"" a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops andif they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was aone-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Sovietbuying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said. Bad weather during the next six weeks could push theSoviets back into the market, weather analysts said. ""A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month anda half,"" Martell said. "

The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report,indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government lastJune directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations. USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp,had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oiland gas operations.

He told a news conference here ""After due consultation withmy colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeriaand all member countries of OPEC remain determined to upholdthe December agreement by adhering strictly to their variousquotas and official selling prices."" Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned. ""We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleadingnews in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC membercountries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in themonth of February,"" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said. Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firmdetermination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrsagreed upon last December in Geneva. The December agreement set an overall output ceiling forOPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixedprices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs. Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord butfell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing morethan the agreed level. ""The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would nothold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases ofOPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,"" Lukmansaid. He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was basedon the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, addingthat Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000bpd. Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,while the production figures of Ecuador and the United ArabEmirates needed to be verified, Lukman said. ""If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreementsucceed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price levelof 18 dlrs,"" the group's president said. He said the OPEC price differentials committee meetingformerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely. ""Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference isat the moment contemplated since most agreements reached inDecember are being adhered to,"" he said. Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrowthe gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed inrelation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied ""We considerthe defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials."" Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawnon stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels wellbelow this time last year and soon they would return to themarket in search of crude. ""We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty inmaintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,""Lukman said. The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which hesaid had contributed to the group's efforts to stabiliseprices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-heldview not to do anything to help the market. ""We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term withtwo-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future isours. We will use that advantage responsibly,"" he said.

2,"General Motors Corp staged an explosiverally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announcedyesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded bystiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analystsagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects. ""I'm very positive on GM,"" said Jack Kirnan of KidderPeabody and Co. ""They're clearly committed to enhancingshareholder value."" However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for thebuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker torecapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buyback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. Theannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on thestock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and atleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on agood performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said therepurchase program is not a positive. ""The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook andputs more stress on the balance sheet,"" he said, since GM willhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stockshould settle back down to around 76, he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from fourdlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domesticcar and truck market falling in 1987. ""On balance, GM cars arenot selling as well as their competitors,"" he said. In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from theyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co <F> andChrysler Corp <C> both posted increases. But GM said Februarysales showed improvement over January, adding that it expectsimprovement in coming months. Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fallto around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and productimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by thefourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback. ""GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling upits sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a majorearnings surprise in the winds,"" he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, inpart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. ""The company is moreconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuationwith respect to Ford and Chrysler,"" he said. Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currentlyfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield thanits competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cashdividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Incsaid U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, ifsuccessful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of itsmarket share. ""I believe their new cars will be successful, but that willonly curtail losses in market share,"" which will fall to around35 pct by 1990, Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middleof the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, hesaid results will not improve until 1988. ""I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is atransition year for GM,"" he said. Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will notaffect 1987 results. ""But the key thing isn't so much what theyearn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that'simportant."" "

5,"Gulf money markets have grown reasonablywell during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remainto a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <GulfInternational Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulfcapital markets that investors have to relinquish traditionalinvestment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bankaccounts and precious metals. ""Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled withmore diversified capital market instruments and a change in thedisclosure requirements on company accounts,"" he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under threecategories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use ofshort-term money market instruments and banks in the region hadfloated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. ""Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a largeextent, fragmented and lagging behind,"" he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loansand bank facilities and very few companies had made use ofstock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stockexchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establishexchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capitalmarkets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had""clearly had a negative impact on the development of capitalmarkets in the region."" In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,financial awareness among investors is still lacking andinvestment analysis and corporate reporting standards lackdepth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s promptedinvestors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in someGulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adoptfinancial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporationof joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be madeavailable to all citizens and institutions of Gulf CooperationCouncil (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, SaudiArabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had beentaken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals toown up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depthfrom the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain andthe expansion of securities repurchase regulations in SaudiArabia. But he added there is ""no bond market to speak of"" in SaudiArabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyaldenominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and tradingin Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formalexchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent,Azzam said. "

As a result, those amounts will be subject to federaltaxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed. Continental said it decided to deal with this change ""inits entirety"" in 1987. Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitationrules, and although the impact will not be material in theshort term, the Act will require, for the first time, thatincome from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the reportsaid.

This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpsells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the nexttwo years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.

3,"Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs indeficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificatesand 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs andsorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs. Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject tothe 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudmanbudget deficit control act of 1985, it said. Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiencypayments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said. The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 centsper bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum werereceived by producers requesting advance payments. Deficiency payments are calculated as the differencebetween an established target price and the higher of the basicloan rate, or the national average price received by farmersduring the first five months of the marketing year --September-January. National weighted average market prices for the first fivemonths of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers willbe paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate. Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 centsper bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs perbushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loanrate. The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are themaximum permitted by law, the department said. Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national averagemarket prices received by farmers during the entire marketingyear for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, thedepartment said. The payments will be issued through local AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said. "

1,"Indonesia appears to be nearing apolitical crossroads over measures to deregulate its protectedeconomy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues, the government haslaunched a series of measures over the past nine months toboost exports outside the oil sector and attract newinvestment. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leadingprimary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year""sfall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue itscurrency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto""sgovernment appears to be divided over what direction to leadthe economy. ""(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard toderegulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,""the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia""s agriculturalsector, but also reviews the country""s general economicperformance. It says that while many government officials and advisersare recommending further relaxation, ""there are equally strongpressures being exerted to halt all such moves."" ""This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,""the report says. Indonesia""s economic changes have been welcomed by the WorldBank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics andsteel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced traderestrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia""s economic growth in calendar 1986was probably about zero, and the economy may even havecontracted a bit. ""This is the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s,"" the report notes. Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with apopulation of 168 million, is facing general elections inApril. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvementin the economic outlook. ""For 1987 early indications point to aslightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economicactivity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in exportearnings from the petroleum industry."" ""Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weakdomestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, realdeclines in construction and trade, and a reduced level ofgrowth in agriculture,"" the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms iscrucial for the government to get the international lending itsneeds. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balanceof payments support was given partly to help the governmentmaintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said. "

2,"Laidlaw Transportation Ltd saidearnings per share for the current fiscal year should increaseby ""substantially more"" than the 30 pct average annual growthexperienced in the last four years. Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unitacquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlawpresident Michael de Groote told analysts. Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs. De Groote also said the company expects ""excellent results""in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be morespecific. He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does notinclude possible further acquisitions and said that theaddition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988through fiscal 1990. De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous fourquarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. Therest came from acquisitions, he said. Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this willnot make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said. He also said he is ""not very optimistic"" about the ongoingnegotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-basedchemical and solid waste services company with Canadian andU.S. operations, from &lt;Trimac Ltd> of Calgary. De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of theproposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within thenext 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemicalwaste business through GSX Corp. ""We feel it is a profitable business with good growthpotential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the rightmanagement,"" de Groote said. Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing. De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs incash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants. De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 willrepresent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses willcontribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct. The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performingwell and there are no plans to sell it, he said. He would not estimate the contribution of each segment toearnings per share for the year. He also said that furtheracquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likelywithin the next few months. "

Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct,compared with no change in January, while consumptionexpenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct,reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January.

1,"Most Japanese companies have decided notto renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spotprices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels,industry sources said. They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubaitraded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to itsofficial price of 17.42 dlrs. Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract forIranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said. The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting atotal of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crudeunder term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift inthe second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd. They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discountson cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discountsdepended largely on the levels of spot prices. ""If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we wouldprobably buy Iranian crude at the official price,"" one Japaneserefiner said. ""We don't intend to put pressure on them,"" he added. Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oilat official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades areconsiderably lower, oil traders said. They said if spot prices move higher there will be noproblem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil afterfinding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem islikely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus. The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself fromOPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to thefixed prices. But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close toits first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demandwould be balanced by the end of the second quarter. They also said if OPEC holds its official price structurebased on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuationsshould be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai anda 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.

""We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart ofour national security,"" subcommittee chairman James Florio, aNew Jersey Democrat said.

The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling UnitedNational Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources assaying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financingfood subsidies and were pressing the government to explain howit proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidieslast December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the movecaused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riotsin which 15 people were killed. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves toquell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost thegovernment about 500 mln kwacha per year.

4,"West German bond yields could declineover the next few months if recent efforts to stabilizeexchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend tokeeping down European interest rates, banking economists said. But in the longer term domestic yields could rise underagreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said. The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilizedcurrencies with the threat of central bank intervention,economists said. Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolsterthe pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest ratesfurther when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April.""The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbankand the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rateare significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S.and foreign interest rates,"" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recentstudy. It said narrowing of international interest rate spreadswas a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads willhave to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized. West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouragedthe U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when theBundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoidweakening the dollar. West German economists see room for further cuts in leadingWest German rates if the dollar resumes its decline. ""It's not a taboo,"" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for CommerzbankAG said. But most economists see room for a cut in West German ratesonly in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflationwill limit room for manoeuvre later in the year. The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is alreadynearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April. Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors toshift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a movewould tend to flatten the yield curve between short andlong-term rates, which has become more pronounced since theBundesbank lowered its discount rate. It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, asthe shift out of savings accounts into securities would slowgrowth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate. But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase WestGerman tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed tomeet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move mayforce interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which mustbe filled by higher government borrowing. This may not occur if private sector demand for creditremains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising. Economists said it appeared the government had alreadystepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss fromother sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker thanexpected economic growth, and higher than expected spending. Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West GermanIfo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by theWest German government in November. Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up.But coupled with other factors such as waning foreignspeculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, longterm yields may to have to rise, economists said. Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing toincreases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package. The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion. West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increasedborrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable. Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday hewas looking for other ways to finance the reform, such asraising indirect taxes. But few economists believe the government will be able togo through with its tax measures without increasing netborrowing. The Bundesbank said in its February report that it waswrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986could be managed without increasing deficits. The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borroweda large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 finalquarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985. The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks ofthe fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billionmarks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when ithad not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.

5,"Taiwan's new controls on currencyinflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a floodof speculative money prompted by the local currency surgeagainst the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said. The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding onemln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance andbank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from anyother source. Petitioners have to show their remittances relate togenuine commercial transactions. Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report alloutward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight,insurance and royalties, to the central bank. But bankers said they believed the new controls would beineffective since businessmen could split up remittances intosmaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan'sflourishing currency black market. The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are apanic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over thepast week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar toslow the growth of Taiwan's exports to the U.S. The government has denied local press reports Washington ispressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs. The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70. ""I don't think the central bank has a final target,"" said anexecutive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists saidthey are wary of making any firm predictions about how far theTaiwan dollar will rise. Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S.Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surpluswidened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billiondlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year. Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculativemoney flowed into Taiwan in 1986. This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to morethan 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time lastyear and provided further upward pressure on the currency. The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct againstthe U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouragingspeculators. Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last weekWashington's pressure plus rising foreign exchange reservesmeant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable. Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to thecurrency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allowthe local dollar to find its own level. ""Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but thecentral bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not wantto take the risk,"" said one local banker. He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporarymeasure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples withthe exchange rate problem. The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirtaround the real issue, he said. Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreignexchange controls, said an executive with a western bank. ""The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bankcharges will not outweigh the profits of speculation,"" said themanager of a European bank. Economists criticised the controls, saying they couldantagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economicliberalisation in Taiwan. ""Instead of liberalising outflows, the government hasrestricted inflows,"" said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickersda Costa. A local banker, who declined to be named, said, ""It'sbasically ridiculous. It's a backward movement and goes againstthe government's liberalisation programme."" Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations toenable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds,treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allowindividuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the countryeach year.

However, several arbitragers said they would shy away fromthe stock at its current price levels since it is unclear howhigh bidding for the company would go and whether the companywould agree to a takeover. ""There are too many uncertainties,"" said one arbitrager. Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4. Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett CapitalInc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating theywere committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast companyand were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150dlrs per share. The company responded that the proposal would be submittedto the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet beenmade on a sale of the company. ""Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs pershare),"" said one arbitrager. Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at currentlevels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per sharerange. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this levelwould be chancy since it will take a long time for anytransaction to be completed because of regulatory approvalsnecessary for the broadcast properites. Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billiondlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejectedthe bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternativessuch as restructuring. Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,which has two large shareholders in an investment group led byRobert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American FinancialCorp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50years ago, has about 12 pct. Lindner last week told the Securities and ExchangeCommission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft. ""I could see if things got really crazy that it might gofor 175 (dlrs per share),"" said one arbitrager, but hespeculated it probably would not even be taken over for morethan a price in the 160s.

The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions todistribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determinethe kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the endof January. President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he wassuspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluationand violent fluctations of the exchange rate which hadresulted. Business and banking sources said another reason forsuspending the auction was that the central bank was low onforeign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successfulbidders.

Specifically, the agency said those making tender offersfor companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide toeliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to betendered in order for the offers to be valid. Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions.As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the sharesthat were tendered if the minimum level were not reached. In an interpretation of current rules, which officials saidclarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tenderoffer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived,even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so. The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum sharecondition is a ""material change"" of the tender offer under U.S.securities law, SEC officials said. The SEC has already said that other specific materialchanges, such as changes in the percentage of securities beingsought or the price being offered, made during the course of atender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer. The length of the extension, which is aimed at givingshareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tenderoffer, was not specified in cases where the minimum shareconditions were waived. SEC officials said the length of the extension in suchcases would depend on the facts and circumstances surroundingeach case, but would generally be between five and 10 days. The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waiversof a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of eachoffer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the newinformation. Officials declined to identify the two offers. ""If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end ofits offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequatedissemination,"" the SEC said.

1,"Saudi Arabian businessleaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing outproblems facing the private sector of the kingdom'soil-dependent economy. The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across SaudiArabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry andcommerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices. The four-day conference in this resort town, high in themountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea,has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce. Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and CommerceMinister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day. Bankers and businessmen said the conference will airproblems facing commerce and industry after last year's slidein oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment ina private sector sorely short of finance. Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia,the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster privateenterprise to diversify its oil-based economy. The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the MiddleEast recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturingand trading companies ran into problems repaying loans. Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accordreached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boostprices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel. With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at theturn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing downforeign reserves. The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure ofconfidence to the business community. Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since lastNovember, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in thenumber of new non-performing loans. But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporatefinance manager in Riyadh said: ""Banks are still reluctant tolend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I amnot sure if it is firmly based."" Some businessmen and bankers point out that governmentspending is still under tight control and the non-oil economymay still be contracting. Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply.A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before thebudget said: ""While industrialisation has continued to be one ofthe government's highest priorities, the recession, thepayments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudiand foreign investor interest in industry."" It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be amajor issue among the businessmen gathered here. Official figures show the number of new licences forindustrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March1986, compared with the same period in 1985. Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a majorsource of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983. Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with hugeinventories of construction equipment as recession bit. Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories.Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reachedagreement with bankers to extend debt repayments. The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotelsconglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled adraft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals ofbank debt. Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likelyto discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms tostep up investment in the kingdom. A British government delegation has just left Riyadh afterholding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudioutlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraftworth five billion stg.

""We got a little volatility Wednesday,"" said StaleyCommodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. ""But for themoment we're still in a trading range."" Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of theU.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of itssluggish state, the analysts said. ""It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it canbreak out of its very low volatility,"" said Carroll McEntee andMcGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. ""It needs something, but it'snot going to be news about the economy,"" he said. Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break outof the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar hasstabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conductmonetary policy. But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, thedollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attractedeager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said. In addition to a changing perception about the dollar andmonetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinnsaid the beginning of April could bring foreign investors backinto the marketplace. ""The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at thebeginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1,"" Quinn said.

If Japaneseinvestment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start ofJapan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bondmarket, he said.

7,"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone willvisit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S.Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats saidthey believed his chances of success were slim. Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups andwidespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will behard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said. News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincidedwith news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surpluslast month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier. It also came one day after the Reagan Administration'sEconomic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory actionagainst Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a jointtrade agreement on computer microchips. Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - onedesigned to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in theshort-term, the other to redirect the country in the mediumterm away from its over-dependence on exports for growth. But government officials said political infighting couldrob both packages of much of their punch and might even preventone from seeing the light of day. Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw upa package of short-term economic measures until after its1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that wouldamount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate. But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time forhis trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott byopposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan. Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to theU.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his rulingLiberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its ownmeasures. He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basisof the government's plans, without losing face in parliamentover the budget, political analysts said. Officials working on the government's short-term economicpackage said it would probably include interest rate cuts onloans by government corporations, deregulation, measures topass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers inthe form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment. They said a record portion of state investment planned forthe entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the firsthalf, probably over 80 pct. Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfyReagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American tradedeficit. To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is alsolikely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-termeconomic plans. A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japangovernor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a finalreport outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy daysbefore Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington. Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up toMaekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and arelikely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas asagricultural reform and land policy, officials said. While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailedas possible, they said the political realities might force themto water down some of the committee's recommendations. A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economymight look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoesmassive restructuring, officials said. The subcommitteeprojects that the current account surplus will fall to lessthan two pct of Japan's total output, or gross nationalproduct, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, whichmeasures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pctof gnp. The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth forJapan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradualappreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around1993, from 150 now.

He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of atwo-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progressmade by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting lastSeptember launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement onTariffs and Trade) talks.

New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleaguesgreat progress had been made in preparing for the current roundof GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked. The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentumtowards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts. Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks wasthat they tended to get bogged down for years. ""Countries don'tget very serious about negotiating until the end of the daywhich is, maybe, five or six years in the future.""

1,"Petro-Canada, Canada'sstate-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineationwells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshoreNewfoundland. Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering workshould put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a developmentplan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said. Depending on time required for regulatory approvals,construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production asearly as 1991, Petro-Canada said. ""We have a high degree of confidence that the westernportion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mlncubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels,and that we could produce it economicly using a floatingproduction system,"" Petro-Canada said. The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St.John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, wasdiscovered by Petro-Canada in 1984. ""We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion ofthe field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove upadditional reserves there,"" the company said. Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercialprospect and the company wants to move some of those resourcestowards development so it can start generating a return oninvestments, Petro-Canada said. Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells,has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block ofthe Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's EastFlank block, a company spokesman said later. Other fieldparticipants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd,Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, TrilliumExploration Corp and general partnership PAREX. Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field'sGraven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil,company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgaryoffice. Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's EastFlank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels,he added. Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrsto bring the field to production by about 1991, and thedevelopment budget could double if the company builds aproduction system combining both blocks in the field, he said. Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven blockwould produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average dailyproduction, with a production system that would have maximumcapacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said inanswer to a query.

4,"Increased federal government borrowingneeds and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buymark assets could push yields in German public authority bondshigher this year, bond market sources say. ""At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-termrates. But how rates move in the long end will depend stronglyon foreigners,"" one portfolio manager for a large securitiesinvestment house in Frankfurt said. The sources also said the government had already stepped upits borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs. Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, thesources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of sixpct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue. This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pctcoupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct. But dealers said the terms were not enough to attractforeign investors, and the federal government would have topush yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon. Sources noted federal government issues had also increasedin size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volumeonly starting last May. One finance ministry economist said ""It isn't more. It'sjust the size (of each bond) which has increased."" He addedconditions in the capital market currently remained fairlyfavourable for raising new debt. Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors. With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, ashopes of further currency gains in marks diminish. Sources said the government has may have already stepped upits borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks. The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowingthrough bonds was 26.6 billion. The sources said this indicated a move by the governmentout of other types of debt to gain access to foreign fundsthrough the more acceptable loan stock form. Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a largeamount of issues maturing recently, other factors, includingthe government's tax reduction program, would also reduceincome next year. ""The problem here will be the tax reform,"" theportfolio manager said. He added that the government's cut in its top income taxrate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult forthe government to reduce borrowings. The sources said the government would fall far short ofcovering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from thetax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced tofall back on debt markets in one form or the other. The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federalgovernment loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallenback twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through theissue of fixed-rate medium-term ""Kassenobligation"" notes. A finance ministry economist said the government did notexpect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only anet 22.3 billion marks this year. Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend wouldprobably not continue next year as the further tax cuts comeinto effect. ""I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform wouldmean government borrowing will increase,"" the manager said. Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, withthe Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculationfalling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier. But sources said foreign demand for the new federalgovernment loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that thedollar may now rise against the mark. ""The demand wasn't so good,"" a dealer for a German bank inLondon said. The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the markeven meant that foreign investors have sold mark bondsrecently, some dealers said. "

2,"World group turnover of Siemens AG&lt;SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the currentyear to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first fivemonths, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said. Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02billion marks. Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly dueto payment in January for a West German nuclear power stationwhich led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct. In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed athree pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures. In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8billion marks against the same 1985/86 period. For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise betweenone and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion. Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, thecommunications and telecommunications sectors in particularshould contribute to growth this year, Kaske said. But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of thedollar, Kaske said. Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 groupnet profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in thesame period in the previous year. Turnover in the first five months rose particularlystrongly in the installations and automotive technology,communications and telecommunications sectors, but componentsand energy and automation showed a sharp decline. Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks inthe first five months of this year, or nine pct above theirlevel in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular byorders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary. Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. Anincrease in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroadwas balanced by the decline in the dollar. While the installations and automotive technology sectorshowed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation andcommunications orders were below the level achieved in the sameperiod of 1985/86. Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the samelevel. Kaske said investments were expected to remain around sixbillion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previousyear. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover. "

He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Fivenations and Canada agreed in Paris to ""see if there can't be aperiod of reasonable stability instead of volatility"" to givetime for the committments in Paris to take place. Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. interventionwas not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied thatthe administration judged that after economic adjustments,current exchange rates reflect underlying economicfundamentals. In particular, the stability sought by the nations wouldallow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economiesdomestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulfordsaid in his testimony. He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar wouldhurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth. Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy wasaffected by international developments. He also said increased Japanese domestic growth wouldresult in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarilylead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Grammasserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market. Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, ""I thinkexchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany's andJapan's) efforts can be carried out. Mulford rejected Gramm's argument that faster domesticgrowth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lowerdollar. Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a patternof higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. tradedeficit. Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolvedeither through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, bothalternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable. "

1,"Saudi crude oil output last month fellto an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpdin January, Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymahterminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last monthfrom 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by somecustomers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulfexports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpdfrom 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but notsales from floating storage, which are generally consideredpart of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under aproduction restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation grouplast December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrsa barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last weekappeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift Februaryentitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continuedsupport for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crudecustomers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Texaco Inc<TX> and Chevron Corp <CHV> -- signed a long-term agreementlast month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia'sability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market willcome this month, when demand for petroleum productstraditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recentweeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterdayreiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accordand said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fellslightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln inJanuary because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail exportrefineries.

1,"The U.K. Government forecasts that oilrevenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in1985/86. The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement andBudget Report issued after the Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament. The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oilrevenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remainingclose to current levels, the Treasury document said. The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall willreflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporationtax is paid after a time lag. The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel differencein oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mlnstg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a fullyear. Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes inproduction would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added. Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are nowestimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts. Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billionstg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of theovershoot. Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year. Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion thisfiscal year. The general government expenditure for the coming fiscalyear is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised164.9 billion in the current year.

The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusionsof the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economicpolicy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at theweekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet. The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interestrate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates. The team's report to the government praises last year'sspending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spendingby 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economyperform ""better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far inthe 1980s."" However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisationof the debt to gross national product ratio requires a muchlower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target thegovernment has set itself for 1989. The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct ofGNP in 1986. The report says ""The most that can be afforded over the nextfew years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure ofgeneral Government."" It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian taxsystem to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced taxburden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising thedebt to GNP ratio before this is possible. ""Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expendituregrowth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions,we feel that your position would be stronger if you coulddecide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988,"" thereport adds. The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal thegovernment's determination to keep its currency strong and tocurb inflation. It says firmer long-term rates would slow private netlong-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986. It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt andan overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate thesubscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues inBelgian francs. "

1,"Kuwait""s Oil Minister, in remarkspublished today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPECmeeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in worldoil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the localdaily al-Qabas as saying: ""None of the OPEC members has askedfor such a meeting."" He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed productionlimits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimateOPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mlnbpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along withthe much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing abovequota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. ""This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which saidKuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose thatbecause Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,"" the ministersaid. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability toproduce up to 4.0 mln bpd. ""If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing theirshare, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,"" he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpdof its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resistingofficial prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a markerof 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levelsthis year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered ""a challenge to any internationaloil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices."" Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs abarrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate. However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil becauseof its local and international refining facilities and its owndistribution network abroad, he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC""sdifferentials committee has been postponed until the start ofApril at the request of certain of the body""s members. Ecuador""s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite saidlast Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assigna lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this attalks this month of opec""s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, inapparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: ""Weexpected such pressure. It will continue through March andApril."" But he expected the situation would later improve. "

4,"Officials of five Thai commercial banksare expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cuttinginterest rates, banking sources said. They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spurdomestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidityon the money market. Many bankers have been urging an average half percentagepoint cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lendingrates, they said. Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan andoverdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, thesources said. Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since earlylast year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The currentgross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank depositand the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade. Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have createdproblems for many banks in managing their money effectively. Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partlybecause of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth.The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thaibanking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansionin bank deposits. Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts havefurther buoyed the Thai stock market this week. The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Mondayrecorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02. Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will registermore gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market. Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem willgrow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission forlocal banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct ofbank capital. If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expirydate, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreignexchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct. Bankers said such that could add another five billion bahtof surplus funds to the local money market. "

U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekendthat the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for thedollar.

1,"Lured by the weakening dollar and theconviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, Europeanenergy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reservesto replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said. They said owning oil reserves in a politically stableUnited States is good insurance against future shortages.However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated upcompetition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choicedomestic oil properties. Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil andgas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyershad helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. Allbuyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs abarrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 foracquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and fivedlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research. ""Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, butwe're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,"" saidArthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist andpresident of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn. ""Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil andgas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,"" he added. Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believethe trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 becauseof the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception thatoil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper tobuy new reserves than to explore for them. Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks tothe need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments andgeneral restructuring throughout the oilpatch. In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of &lt;Total CompagnieFrancaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs toseparately acquire oil assets of Texas International &lt;TEICC>and Lear Petroleum Partners &lt;LPP>. A spokesman for Minatomesaid the company is searching for additional acquisitions. A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, &lt;Petrofina S.A.>and &lt;Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buyvirtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos &lt;WMB>,the Oklahoma pipeline firm. But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventureswith experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's&lt;Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's &lt;TX> Texaco USA in a100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined withDupont's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal. Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, itsgeographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil aremore important factors in evaluating potential acquisitionsthan relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula. Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representingInternational Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of &lt;PreussagCorp> and &lt;C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm hadearmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves inTexas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months. But he called that a small amount compared to the amountother investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's GeodyneEnergy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend upto 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties. ""The competition is stiff, not only from other foreigninvestors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oilcompanies,"" he said. ""Our company is shopping around because wefeel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. Ifyou're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you needprices higher than the current market,"" he added. In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokeragehouses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were alsocompeting for prime properties. Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group&lt;RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying andselling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquiredtwo billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels ofoil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said. ""Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of thesecompanies,"" Smith said. ""Domestic production has dropped by onemln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it maydrop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988."" "

5,"The Bundesbank bought large amountsof dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollarabove 149 yen, dealers said. The dollar intervention was in concert with some othercentral banks, they said. Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of Englandsupported the dollar against the yen earlier today and thatthese two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also activeyesterday. The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers' remarks. Dealers said the intervention underlined the determinationof central banks to keep currencies within recent rangesfollowing last month's agreement in Paris by six leadingcountries to foster currency stability. One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with theBundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buydollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves. He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing thesituation to see if it should intervene in consultation withother central banks. Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar haduntil yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to testcentral banks' resolve to defend currency stability. But the test came this week with the dollar falling below1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade disputebetween Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that thedollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S.Trade deficit were behind the weakness. This week's intervention showed central banks were preparedto cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said. Dealers said it was significant the West German and Britishcentral banks were supporting the dollar against the yen. That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation bycentral banks to foster currency stability, they said. But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arrangedand how frequent consultations between central banks were. "

4,"This week's Bank of England resistance tostrong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded inholding bank base rates at 11 pct. But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the ParisGroup of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterlingbroadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sourcessaid. Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closingtrade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after theParis meeting and up 0.4 on the day. Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19. A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanteda substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question istherefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting. Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch EuropeLtd, estimated that the government wanted to see thetrade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. ""Even after this actionover the last few weeks, sterling's only just within strikingdistance of that range,"" he said. Other analysts agree that the government probably has somebroad target range around this area. However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see thepound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk ofa loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports. ""If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as theyare, what's to stop it (going higher),"" said John Cox, executivedirector of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the Londonforeign exchange market. Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been activeselling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack ofgeneral market talk of such intervention, and this has helpedkeep it below 1.60 dlrs. The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting. But Cox says the government must be worried with sterlingheading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if itholds around these levels. He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interestrate boat. ""If rates don't come down, the market will say theyought to have come down and will sell sterling,"" he said. Most dealers agree there is a good deal of ""hot money"" beinginvested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnightor one-week rates, which could flow out at equally shortnotice. However, the authorities will hope that at least aproportion of the buying reflects long-term investment. ""The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) andhave to jack them back up again,"" said Richard Jeffrey,economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd. He said a half point cut would ensure continued support forsterling, at least in the near term. However, most analysts are still looking for a full pointabout March 17, Budget Day. The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to theBudget, said Temperton. The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in therun-up to a general election, the major factor behind currentbullishness in the government bond and currency markets. ""Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest ratecut,"" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, theequities arm of Mercury International Group. Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead theway lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall inthe weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct lastFriday might mean the Bank had changed its mind. This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 113/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowestsince base rates were at 10 pct, early last October. However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-monthsmoney, banking sources said the market could not take the cutas a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates. "

7,"Firms need not be pessimistic about exportprospects even though foreign markets have become moredifficult because of the mark's strength the Economics Ministrysaid.  The ministry's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georgvon Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports couldstart rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing thelower export trend which emerged in mid-1986. But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be noneed to worry about the economy as long as the weakness ofexports did not affect currently good domestic demand. Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good butnoted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. ""Thisis certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not forstimulative steps,"" he said. The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to workactively to promote free world trade, he added. Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good exportopportunities. Price alone was not the only factor ininternational competitiveness, he said, adding German firmshave a reputation for high quality standards, prompt deliverytimes and good service. Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficultposition on its trade figures.  It faced international pressureto reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worriedabout the effect of the mark's strength on the country'sexporters. Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas,tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to arecord 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise wasdue entirely to the lower value of imports caused by thedecline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports havein fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said. "

Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct lastSeptember to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latestcut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level. Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its10 pct production cutback until mid-1987. However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual reportthat Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to anaverage 510,000 bpd in 1987. The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude pricesat 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permitfurther production cutbacks, the sources said. Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bblthis year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said. Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add tothe tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reducedIndonesian and Chinese crude output. The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, asthere is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases dueto the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said. In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering twoto three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each monthfor sale through tender, the sources said.

Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies mustshow restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses thathave marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire andHumberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annualdinner. Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve tieswith institutional investors, suggesting representatives ofthose institutions be granted seats on the boards of directorsof companies they invest in. ""Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,for that is but a short step from saying that they should beprotected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,the proprietors of the company,"" Leigh-Pemberton said. He added takeovers and mergers had an important role toplay in furthering economies of scale, integration and moreefficient market penetration. ""The degree of success or failure(of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether ornot the takeover was contested,"" he said. Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeoveractivity in the recent past. ""The aim is to pressurise acompany's management into action dedicated solely to afavourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partlyor even primarily at the expense of the future,"" he said. Such bids ""often depend for their success on creating ahighly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, toengage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that areimmensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,"" hesaid. In a clear reference recent events, he said ""those in theCity who act for companies or individuals ..

""You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyonsin the second half,"" Holden-Brown said following a presentationto Toronto securities analysts. Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth inprofit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported inthe first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mlnstg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year. Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary costof slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costsassociated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for thecompany, Holden-Brown also said.

7,"Japan has launched a last-ditch effort tosalvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States -sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out itscase and instructing its producers to cut output further. ""We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,""Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) DeputyDirector General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters. ""If hasty action is taken in the United States, it willcreate very serious problems."" The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected tomeet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateralagreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreedto stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and toincrease its imports of American semiconductors. Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal byselling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boostAmerican imports, and has threatened to take retaliatoryaction. In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanesechip makers to limit production in the hope that will boostdomestic demand and reduce the incentive to export. Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobitdynamic random access and erasable programmable read onlymemory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows acutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of theyear. He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply ofchips available for export through unregulated distributors inthe so-called grey market. ""We have almost no grey market,"" he said. ""Supply isdiminishing."" To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITIcalled in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker,NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuingspecific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiaryof &lt;Texas Instruments Inc>. Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out thesteps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed forU.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers. The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State GeorgeSchultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce SecretaryMalcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, areexpected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip makerMicron Technology Inc &lt;DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales inHong Kong. Yamamoto admitted that &lt;Oki Electric Industry Co>'s HongKong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level butdenied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices. ""If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...Wewill present our rebuttal,"" he said. The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI'sadvice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well aboveproduction costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said. He also called the case ""strange,"" but he stopped short ofendorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had beentrapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micronpublicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same daythey were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person whohad bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.

The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyalsin the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister SheikhAbdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected tospend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.

Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due touncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the governmentdecided to limit recurrent expenditure each month toone-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15pct. He urged heads of government departments and publicinstitutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. Hedid not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.

Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGLshare if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders. SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited. In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it wasdenied confidential information on SGL that would be given toother potential bidders. SGL officials could not be reached for comment. Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for thesale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers,but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access toSGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with keyemployees. ""We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyoutfirms,"" said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGLmanagement may be considering a leveraged buyout. Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on afriendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate allthe terms of its offer. Dart said SGL representatives said the company has notreceived any other offer. It said it requested the confidential information to betterunderstand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to signan agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL withoutSGL's approval. The agreement would also have limited its ability to buySGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditionsunreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendlytransaction, it said. Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares. Dart said it requested the information before its meetingwith SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hoperepresentatives would reach an agreement. It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was toldthere were certain issues important to SGL management and whilethey were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to takethem into account in putting together its package. It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mlndlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vicepresident James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine. Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers'severance agreements, although there was an implication thatLieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of theirown volition. Dart said under their present agreements, none of theseofficers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also,Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management'sincentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a costof six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the sharesunless waived by the company's compensation committee. Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for topmanagement's supplemental retirement plan. Dart said another issue was to agree to future severanceobligations and future salary guarantees for top management,estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligationsunder the company's present policy. Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed todiscuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try tonegotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL. Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chainand Rickels home centres. Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filedby an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking suchactions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence. The suit also sought to have directors carry out theirfiduciary duty. Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by anunwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue ofsecurities to shareholders which make a takeover moreexpensive. "

Hair called the department's proposal a ""reflection of alargely political decision,"" adding ""we have no confidence inInterior to represent the broad public interest in this area."" Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plainto oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen. It said a preliminary survey showed the region could holdbillions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential asan energy resource would never be known without exploration. Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain. Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gasexploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain awildlife refuge protected from commercial development. Hair said Interior's report failed to stress theprobability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct. He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas,fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gatherednor had the department consulted the Environmental ProtectionAgency on the possible effects of exploration. The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that anine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of theissue and report back to Congress in about two years. Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possibleexploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate tomake a sound judgement. Congressional observers said that at present there waslittle sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area forcommercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that theUnited States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil.

1,"Australia's crudeoil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of atargeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resourcesand Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here. He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association(APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing apackage that would recognise the government's economicpriorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns. Evans was referring to a nearly completed government reviewof oil taxation. Evans said there were plenty of examples where targetedapproaches to oil industry taxation had produced good resultsin recent years. These include the reduction in the top marginal crudeexcise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshoreoil announced last September, he said. The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for theelimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boostincentives for prospecting against a background of weak pricesand Australia's relatively low exploration levels. ""While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity toan already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favourthese kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes,which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may stillleave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies aregoing to do in major areas,"" Evans said. He said the government did not intend to change itsresource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now beforeparliament, in response to industry calls to allow allexploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible. As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited tohighly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after acertain rate of return has been achieved for individualprojects. APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax becauseexploration deductibility is limited to successful projects. Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based morethan anything on the government's desire to ensure thecertainty and stability of the new regime, adding that majorinvestments have already been planned on the existing groundrules.

In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister ShunjiroKarasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that theministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S.Firms that have expressed interest. But it does oppose any foreign internationaltelecommunications carrier having a management role, he said. The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Oppositionto the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to competewith the current monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd>, andto reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable andWireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, industry analysts and diplomats said. One of the rival firms, &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc>(ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firmsincluding General Electric Co &lt;GE>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> andCitibank NA &lt;CCI), and two European companies, ITJ presidentNobuo Ito said yesterday.

Merrill Lynch and CoInc &lt;MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc &lt;PAC>, both ofthe U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively. The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged themerger of the two firms because it says the market can onlysupport a single KDD competitor. It has also rejected management participation by aninternational common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless,arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists. Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, JonathanSolomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes amerger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share toless than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20pct, the ministry official said. Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitorwould most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless'share, industry analysts said.

3,"Indonesia""s agriculture sector will growby just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pctin 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates ordeclines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report. Production of Indonesia""s staple food, rice, is forecast tofall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report onIndonesia""s agricultural performance. The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in1987. The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mlntonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because ofa drawdown on stocks. ""Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not lookpromising as rice production is forecast to decline and theproduction of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or nogain,"" the report says. ""The modest overall increase which is expected will be dueto significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oiland palm kernels."" Constraints to significant overall increases inagricultural output include a shortage of disease resistantseeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance byfarmers to shift from rice production to other crops, thereport underlines. The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak ofpests known as ""wereng"" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 whichlargely offset gains in yields. The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are nowresistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, moreresistant rice types. The government is depending on increased production ofexport commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood andpalm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crudeoil prices. Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pctin 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports risingto an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, thereport says. But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) willrise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports willalso rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybeanmeal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of lastSeptember""s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a risein domestic demand. The report said that Indonesia""s overall economicperformance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slightnegative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pctin 1984. The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsiblefor the slump. "

2,"International Business Machines Corp,hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back bythe end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst RickMartin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said. ""There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit notuntil later this year,"" Martin said at a technology conferencesponsored by the investment firm. Martin said the coming rebound reflects new productintroductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drasticimprovement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending. IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs inmid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at149-1/2 dlrs. Analysts, computer industry executives, and the companyitself, have highlighted the external economic factorshampering IBM's growth. But Martin said the product cycle was key to understandingthe rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, andpointed to Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> to support his view.""By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,"" he saidof DEC's line of VAX computers. In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatiblemid-range product line. A new computer code-named ""Fort Knox""was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-rangesystems, but the product never got off the ground, he said. Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into theIBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects shouldbe unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. ""The major story will be arebound in its mid-range business."" He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growthin mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988. High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are comingto the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth willdrop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said. By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martinsaid. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of51.3 billion dlrs. Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earningsand stock have been propelled by a strong slew of productintroductions in the mid-range area. In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat toDEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies werecatering largely to existing customer bases, rather thanstealing market share from one another.

5,"Nigeria's Central Bank has changed therules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analystssee as a means of defending the naira currency, which hasdepreciated steadily. The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banksbidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate theyoffered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowestsuccessful bid made at the auction. This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensurethat they were successful while paying the lower ""marginal"" rate,analysts said. ""It should act as a brake because banks will know that ifthey bid high they will have to pay what they offered,"" aWestern diplomat commented. The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pctsince the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign ExchangeMarket (SFEM), began last September 26. At last week's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row. ""They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way oftrying to stop the trend,"" the diplomat said. The Central Bank also announced the auctions would befortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2. It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday'sscheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank wasplanning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offerat each auction. Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstrippedsupply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus furtherweakening the naira. If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at thefortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objectiveof the new system, analysts said. Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, theofficial exchange rate for the naira applying to businesstransactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- thelowest successful bid. SFEM is a central part of Nigeria's structural adjustmentprogram, which is considered to be the most ambitious economicrecovery plan in Black Africa. The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate forthe naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalisingimports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducinginefficient government participation in the economy. The World Bank has played a prominent part in designingthis dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an oftensceptical public which fears inflation and lower livingstandards. Ishrat Husain, the World Bank's representative in Nigeria,said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustmentprogram as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions. ""So far so good"" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos,adding that only members of Nigeria's import-dependent elitewould suffer hardship while the common man would benefit. Fears that the program would encourage inflation wereincorrect, he said. Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urbanprices had already reflected the naira's black market valuebefore the currency was allowed to find its true level lastSeptember. "

Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally todiscuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launchedin Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September. Yeutter said ""at least people seem to be going down the sameroad...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations isanother matter entirely."" There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal withthe problem quickly and ""a more common understanding of how weare going to get from here to there,"" Yeutter said. However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple ofyears of tough negotiations ahead, he said. ""It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to ploughimmense amounts of financial resources into the production ofitems that nobody wants to buy,"" he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of thefinancial resources now committed to agriculture to other moreproductive areas. This would help agriculture because some itsinefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, hesaid. Individual segments in many countries may lose in theprocess, but it should result in a more rational system ofworld-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach arelatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably morethan that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture inthe negotiations, he said ""one has to be politicallyrealistic...

The United States has accused Japan of reneging on thesemiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-priceJapanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened totake retaliatory action after April 1. The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop sellingcut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports ofAmerican chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus. MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has beenpressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that willboost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export. Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers toreduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request,they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeksof the first quarter. If that reduced production level were maintained through tothe end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pctbelow that of the first three months of the year.

""The measures to take effect by June were designed to liftrestrictions on foreign currency operations, in line withderegulation in the banking industry,"" he said in a telephoneinterview. The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controlshighlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday. The central bank said in a statement the measures includedincreased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provisionfor future pension fund obligations. It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulateSpain's financial sector, a move triggered by entry into theCommunity last year. Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, aprocess that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreignbanks to open branches. Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market andthey now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets. Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreigncurrency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against aprevious ceiling of 750 mln pesetas. The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between thatdate and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into thecountry on new foreign currency loans. The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billionpesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would begiven clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days. Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreigncurrency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, byissuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper. They can also employ these funds to invest in foreignissues, while before they had to be converted into deposits. Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies,instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency. The central bank has also lifted the restriction on theamount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limitedto three times a bank's capital equity. The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by mostbankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month whichimposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible pesetafunds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates. The reserve requirement, which was already in place onnormal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreignspeculative capital which is entering the country andthreatening the government's money supply growth target. A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which nowaccount for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at adisadvantage with European competitors. The government reduced fixed asset investment requirementsto 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact ofinterest rate deregulation. ""The real problem is the freeing ofinterest rates,"" the banker said. ""This is going to take a bigbite out of profits."" The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paidon deposits of up to 180 days. The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said themeasure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits thisyear. "

7,"A free trade pact between the UnitedStates and Canada could spur the economies of both sidessubstantially, according to a study released by the Institutefor International Economics. The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusionto the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada'sgross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S.export's by about seven pct. He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue ofgovernment subsidies, end curbs on trade in services andinvestments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States and Canada - the world's two biggesttrading partners with cross border shipments of about 150billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. Theyare aiming for a pact by next October. Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity ofMaryland, said an agreement should include: - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phasedin over a five to 10-year period; - Equal access to federal government procurement in the twocountries, replacing current ""Buy America"" and ""Buy Canada""provisions with a ""Buy North America"" provision; - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly financeand transportation; - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favordomestic producers; - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.  Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, thetwo sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties. The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct. He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offsetsubsidies should go first a special disputes commission forresolution at an early stage. Wonnacott said ""bilateral free trade would contribute to theefficiency of the North American economies and to theircompetitiveness in facing overseas producers. He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadiangoods and enable them to benefit from the economies of massproduction. Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those toCanada proportionately, he said, because of the already largeU.S. gross national product. Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areasas export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commissioncould set an example for the current attempt by GATT to writenew and more liberal global trading regulations.

0,"Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlrpurchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Incbrokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurersare likely to follow, securities analysts said. The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage housesis likely to pay off in dollars and international marketposition, they said. ""It's part of a trend towards growingcapital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreignfinancial institutions,"" said Simon Smithson, an analyst withKleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm describedby some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will giveNippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions onWall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of itsassets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in businesssectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory assetmanagement, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and theworld's biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve thedeal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese lifeinsurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japaneseinsurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocksand sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets andinstruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official wasappointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co'sboard and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become alimited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co. Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller andproblem-plagued banks in 1984. ""But now Japanese are going forblue-chip organisations,"" he said. ""It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturingindustries,"" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. ""With ahistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan."" Competition in fund management has grown along with greaterJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mlnyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17to 18 pct, he said. To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas andgain experience with financial instruments which are likely tospread to Japan with further deregulation. ""The high regulatoryenvironment has delayed (life insurance firms')diversification. Now there's a growing number of new productsin an environment of increasing competition for performance onfund management,"" Smithson said. "

7,"Sir Roy Denman, Head of the ECDelegation in Washington, said pending U.S. trade legislationis a misguided attempt to deal with the nation's trade deficitand will spark retaliation if passed in its present form. ""To think that you can deal with a trade deficit bylegislation is a mistake,"" he told the Foreign TradeAssociation here. Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which hewarned of in a letter to House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on aproduct-for-product basis. ""Retaliation does not have to be matched product toproduct,"" Denman said. He said in the case of textiles import restrictions,however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports. ""Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on Europeanexports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likelyto retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports toEurope,"" Denman said. He also took exception to U.S. proposals to requirecountries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. tocut those surpluses or face special tariffs. ""This would conflict with international obligations, throwa large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations andcould easily boomerang,"" he warned of the tariff proposals. Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seekreciprocity in specific trade sectors. ""Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barrierswould simply lead to retaliation from the other party,"" hesaid, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved bytrading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages inanother.

6,"As a British government investigation gotunder way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of FreeEnterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts hadalready been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship. Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminaryinvestigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferrycapsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred toleave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover. Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decksthrough the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, TownsendThoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed. Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to theHerald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not plannedto pull them out of service at present. ""Our investigator is there already. We shall have to waitand see. But it is too early to say what happened,"" he told BBCradio. As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submergedhulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubtshad already been expressed about the design of so-called ""RoRo""ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise. In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International MaritimeConsultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-onroll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deckareas divided by bulkheads. Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West Germanyard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safetystandards. But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers wouldhave had problems getting off this type of ship because of itsdesign. Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langleysaid the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects toa barge. ""As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches outof line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship iscompartmentalised and you have more stability,"" he said. Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectlystable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level. ""If you do get water into that area then you can get verysevere effects on the stability of the ship,"" he added. "

In comments at a news conference of &lt;Vontobel Holding AG>,chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks'own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board,to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in. A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swissfranc market and a debate on the use of registered shares toprevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers. Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to themarket with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which werereadily available to professionals through specialisedinformation systems. ""We should make this classification obligatory and publishit in places that are easily accessible to lay people,"" he said.The quick changing nature of the financial market meant theseratings should also be continually updated, he said.

However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said.

5,"Leading industrial nations will meetagain next month to review their accord on currency stability,but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for nowthe countries will live up to commitments to speed up economicgrowth. The narrow currency movements of recent weeks stronglysuggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed thenormally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seemlikely to build on that stability. A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreementlast month was the main reason markets were calm. But he said in an interview that financial markets alsounderstood, ""That all six countries concluded that the measuresto be taken over a period of time in the future should fosterstability of exchange rates around current levels. That is infact what has happened since Paris."" Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part bythe decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet andcease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives. Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, butleft room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings. The official refused to comment, however, on whether theagreement included a secret pact to consider furthercoordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nationshave taken jointly several times in the past year. On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies werewithin ranges broadly reflecting underlying economicconditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budgetdeficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth. The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position infuture international talks. ""I think these changes will strengthen the President's handpolitically and the stronger he is politically the better offwe are with the Congress and the better off we are ininternational fora,"" said the official, an Administrationeconomic policymaker. ""So it would be beneficial to thecontinued conduct of our initiatives."" But the official also said the Administration would resistcalls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a targetEuropeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability. Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened tostop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood tohave intervened to curb sterling's strength. International monetary sources say finance ministers andcentral bankers, who will review market performance and theirown economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washingtonjust before the April 9 policymaking meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund. The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Parispact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker. Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April toshow that an economic stimulus package was in the offing. Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recentlywhen Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl toldbankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates ifthe Fed was ready to follow suit. A Reagan Administration official said this would show therehad been some change in approach on the part of the centralbank in Germany. But he declined to comment on the prospects for action bythe Fed and the Bundesbank. ""If there is such a provision it is private and if I talkedabout it, it would no longer be private,"" said the official, whoasked not to be identified. Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bankis keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if themajor economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinatedaction could be on the April agenda.

1,"The Kenyan economy is heading fordifficult times after a boom last year, and the country musttighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swingingtoo far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said. In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi saidhigh coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growthof five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985. The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance ofpayments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in1985, he added. ""But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As aresult, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchangereserves during the year,"" he said. The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreignexchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from apeak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986. Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs abarrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs. Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general declinein the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it moredifficult to finance the government's budget deficit. Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget onservicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter ofcapital for the first time in its history, he added. ""This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficultphase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative thatwe raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreignsources to finance our development,"" he said.

1,"A government study has concluded theU.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into thenext century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability,the New York Times said. The newspaper said the inter-agency government study founda serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily fallingdomestic production and rising demand for imported oil. The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relyingon foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peakof 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate duringthe 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said. It said recommendations sent to the White House by EnergySecretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raisedomestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from thecurrent 8.4 mln barrels. The newspaper said the administration has placed increasedemphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now heldis that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in timesof shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day,rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget.

5,"The yen could rise to 140 yen to thedollar, a leading Japanese businessman said. Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential JapanFederation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), toldreporters: ""The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar).The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economyis not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan)."" ""The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S.Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as theAmerican situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise,"" hesaid. To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said. He rejected recent calls from some government quarters forwage increases this year as a means of raising privateconsumption and thus boosting domestic demand. ""We have to keep wages as low as possible,"" he said. He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressingthe outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in additionto hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic marketmanufacturers through cheap imports. Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsukisaid. Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and adownturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect serviceindustries, he said. It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fullyemploy those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, hesaid. Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall inthe business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possiblerecession in the Japanese economy, he said. Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyondlevels experienced in 1986. The government's Economic Planning Agency said last weekthe economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performancesince 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oilprice crisis.

7,"The United States' emphasis on itsforeign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's realproblem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the GeneralAgreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.  By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billiondlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressurewhich threatens the world trading system, it said in an annualreport. The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federalbudget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting governmentspending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt,it said. GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pctin 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of theprevious two years. GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism andinstead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the currentaccount payments deficit -- higher private savings, lowerinvestment and a smaller federal budget deficit. Raising U.S. Trade barriers ""would result in little or noreduction in the current account deficit. It would, however,increase inflation and reduce world trade,"" it said. ""The basic cause -- some combination of insufficientdomestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- wouldremain,"" the report said. GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this yearbecause of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some WestEuropean nations as they adjust production and workforces to alow dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over ThirdWorld debt management and looming protectionism. The report also said imbalances in the current accounts ofJapan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986. The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changeswere not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added. ""Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reducedas a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was notborne out last year,"" the report said. GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in theU.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidlyexpanding money supply and low dollar. ""Such a development could worsen the business climate byincreasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, inturn, would adversely affect world trade."" But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to theUnited States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makesforeign products more expensive. It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both humanand in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce thegoods and services sought from abroad. World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,about half of the rate of the previous year. Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATTsaid. Developing countries' exports declined significantly, whiletheir imports increased moderately, although full statisticsare not available yet, GATT said. The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nationswere sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports. "

1,"The government'sover-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affectingAustralia's economic performance, Australian PetroleumExploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said. Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income isderived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weakcrude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here. This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts thecountry's economic performance directly by acting as adisincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affectingtrading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said. Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiencyposition is posing a major economic threat, yet thegovernment's response has been to load new tax burdens on theoil industry, Benbow said. Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected tofall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of theBass Strait fields, he said. Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with thethree largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said. By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just overhalf the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undevelopedfields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery fromexisting fields goes ahead, Benbow said. Government projections of output from as yet undiscoveredfields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said. Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying acrude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five yearstime, he said. At present world oil prices and the current value of theAustralian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would costbetween 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said. Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, theaddition to reserves has been inadequate, he said. For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the fiveyears 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said. He called on the government to review its tax policies torestore incentive to exploration. "

5,"Central bank intervention in theforeign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar'slosses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currencyis headed for a further retreat. Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceivethat the six major industrial nations have differing levels ofcommitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies. Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway overthe currency market than central bank intervention and theseargue for a further dollar decline, dealers said. ""The market can be bigger than the central banks. Andeconomic fundamentals will always come to the fore,"" said adealer at one major U.S. bank. As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against theyen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan,Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in themarkets on behalf of the U.S. currency. Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollarrecover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon fromthe post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it stillfailed to regain Monday's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen. Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollarsyesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that theFed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yentoday. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchaseda small amount of dollars for yen. The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank ofJapan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to havesignalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks. The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperateto foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels. But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed bythe authorities' intervention which they said can only softenextreme moves in the market. For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed'spurchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather thanfor the U.S. central bank's own account, suggesting a rather  watered-down American commitment to the currency accord. The Bank of England's action also was thought to becompleted on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcingthe market's view that Japan is the most resolute of the sixnations in its support of the currency pact. ""No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the othertwo central banks seem to be making more token gestures thananything else,"" said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp. ""I'm not convinced the intervention was concerted,"" saidEarl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. ""It's a yen problem more than anything else."" Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionistsentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the Americanauthorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen. ""The dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties theTreasury's hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene onits own account because of the strength of protectionism here,""said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp. Such comments reflect the view that the currency marketsare becoming increasingly politicized. Despite officialdenials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance alower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit. The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise tradedeficit in 1986 was with Japan. Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker's comment onSunday that the February currency pact had not establisheddollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell theU.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat. ""The dollar still has more room on the downside against theyen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. Thecurrency market is becoming very political,"" said Natsuo Okadaof Sumitomo Bank Ltd. Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yenthis week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the endof April or early May. Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating theireconomies, it may not be enough to solve structural economicimbalances in the near future, dealers said. ""Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, itwon't be enough to help the trade situation much,"" saidBourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to148 yen in the next couple of days.

In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bankand Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, ""I believethat increased diversification along geographic and productlines is the key to strengthening the American banking system."" He said he supported the idea of financial services holdingcompanies advocated by the Association of Bank HoldingCompanies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiarieswould be handled on functional lines. ""Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by thebank to the associated institutions, and all transactions wouldhave to be on an arms-length basis,"" Heller said. Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries. Heller said he ""would require the holding company to serveas a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment tomaintain the bank's capital. ""In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail aslong as the holding company has a positive net worth."" Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permittedto own a financial services holding company, again with theprovision that capital would flow to the financial enterpriseif necessary. Heller said the effects of these actions ""would be banksthat are at least as strong as the corporations holding them"" inwhich customer deposits were assured while any incentive to""loot the bank"" was removed. Such diversification would give access to national andinternational financial services to corporations across theUnited States. Heller said that would mean ""the steady decline of America'sbanks in the world financial league tables would be arrested"" bypermitting them to become more competitive. "

5,"West Germany takes ""very seriously"" therecent undertaking by major industrial countries to promoteexchange rate stability around current levels, Finance MinistryState Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said. Talking to journalists before a meeting of EuropeanCommunity Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyerdeclined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by theGroup of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreementsfor stabilising currencies. But he noted the official communique said the participantsagreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchangerates around current levels. ""We're taking this sentence veryseriously,"" he said. Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved againstthe mark since the meeting. He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had beencaused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Parisagreement should help in this respect. Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said theBonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster theeconomy but was paying close attention to the slower growth andhad not ruled out ""appropriate and timely"" action if necessary. Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussionby the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on theeconomic situation in the 12-nation bloc. The Commission has sharply revised down expected Germangross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pctpredicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any ECcountry to stimulate economic activity. Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowedin the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend inview that would make quick remedial action necessary. He said a number of favourable indicators such as highlevel of investment and a good climate for consumption meant arecovery could be expected, while exports would pick upslightly during the course of the year.

7,"World Bank President Barber Conablelinked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World'ssixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade anddismantle protectionist barriers. ""We would like to see the Indonesian government continue theadjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulationof the economy,"" Conable told a press conference at the end of athree-day visit to Jakarta. Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia'shard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by thegovernment to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency. The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlrtrade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend onthe economic policies Indonesia adopted. But he said that in meetings with both President Suhartoand leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specificpolicy changes. ""The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesiangovernment. We are not here to dictate to them,"" he stated. Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badlyhit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenuesfrom crude exports in half. Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morningwith Suharto. He voiced support for measures already taken, includingSeptember's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts toderegulate imports and stimulate exports. ""The government can rely on the support of the World Bank ina continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities oftoday's world,"" he said. The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over thepast 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year. The World Bank would probably like to see furtherdismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduceIndonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plasticsand cement, western bankers and diplomats said. The government has already said it will announce furtherderegulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is alsoconsidering selling off loss-making state companies. Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia findfunds to cover its share of development projects, whichotherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed.

Royal Bank said it set its provisions ""given the continueddebt-servicing problems ... in the North American energyindustry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices,"" and alsocontinued to add to its general provisions for loans totroubled borrower countries. The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter endedJanuary 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in theyear-ago quarter. The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loanlosses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0billion dlrs a year ago. In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman AllanTaylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loansassociated with the energy sector--continue to have asubstantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings. Taylor said profitability of the bank's internationaloperations remains weak, reflecting resource-relateddifficulties of private and public sector borrowers andunsatisfactory results from capital market activities. Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on theoutcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or theirpotential impact on the Royal Bank.

Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26billion marks, 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period.However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximatelyunchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks whencurrent orders from major projects are booked. Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end-February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billionfor the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pctincrease in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks. Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at8.64 billion marks. Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pctyield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profitstotalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against theprevious year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks. Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks.

5,"The sharp drop in the value of thedollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious testof last month's Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement tostabilise currencies, dealers and bank economists said. ""The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinatedcentral bank intervention,"" one dealer for a German bank said,echoing widepread sentiment in the market. But opinion was divided on whether the united front forgedin Paris still exists. Some dealers said there were growingsigns the United States wanted the dollar to fall further. Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention, the dollarplunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today. It was quoted as lowas 148.40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said theyexpected the U.S. Currency to decline further. ""The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yenrange,"" Chase Bank AG's senior dealer Eckhart Hager said. Others said there were technical reasons for the sharpdollar drop. ""Window-dressing"" operations by some Japanesecompanies who were selling dollars and buying yen before theend of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were underminingthe U.S. Currency. Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was nottechnical. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comment theParis accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as arenewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollardown. ""Suddenly, support levels which had existed for fear ofcentral bank intervention disappeared,"" one dealer said. The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5billion dlrs, and this with comments by Japanese officialsindicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge, dealers said.Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bankintervention if necessary. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today thetime had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris lastmonth to stabilise currencies - Japan, Britain, Canada, France,the U.S. And West Germany - to take action in line with thepact. But the Bundesbank and other European central banks werenot detected in the open market during the European morning.Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act. While some said the West German central bank would supportthe dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said theBundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marksor if the decline accelerated. The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when thedollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks. ""The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment,"" onedealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks andgovernments was easier said than done. Some said Baker's remarks and U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter's warning that the U.S. And Japan were on theverge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift. ""It's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands,"" adealer said. Another added, ""If the Americans do not get whatthey want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6."" Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success forthe Paris agreement in its latest investment letter. ""It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing orable to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset thenecessary U.S. Fiscal contraction,"" Citibank said. It added, ""Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marksis not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marksor even less is expected this year."" And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987economic report, ""We are looking for a further, more gradual,fall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year."" But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still inforce was not universal. Some dealers said not too much shouldbe read into Baker's and Yeutter's comments. ""There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has brokendown,"" a senior dealer said. "

7,"Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said""significant progress"" was being made in trade talks with theUnited States and a profile of a major deal was emerging. Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons,Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs inCanada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries. Mulroney, who offered few new details of the talks, saidthat while the negotiations were risky and difficult, ""aprofile of a major trade deal is now emerging.""  In a 50-minute address, Mulroney made an often passionatedefense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areasof the country a major economic boost. ""Because of our trading patterns over a period of decades,we are in the process of building two Canadas -- one that isrich and promising, one that is under-developed andunder-employed,"" said Mulroney. ""What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and BritishColumbians and Albertans and others, that they get theirchance. They must be given the opportunity to trade their wayto prosperity."" Few detials have been released on the trade talks whichwere launched nearly two years ago between the two nations thatare each others most important trading partners. Recent published reports in Canada, quoting senior tradesources, said the countries were close to reaching a trade dealand it will involve eliminating border trariffs and manynon-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years. It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks isa Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes,something that would give Canada protection from Washington'stough trade remedy laws. But Mulroney, sharply critical of protectionist sentimentin the U.S, said Canada was a ""fair trader"" and denied thegovernment was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to theAmerican market. He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides. ""We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal, one that isfair to both sides,"" Mulroney said. "

""we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a timeof protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there areclear benefits to both sides,"" he said.

""therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been aconsideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seenwhat such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impacton today's agreement,"" adams said.

7,"A senior British official said thatprotectionist bills being considered by Congress could triggerretaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten theglobal trading system. Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said ifCongress passed legislation to curb textile imports, whichwould hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asiantextile producers, ""the community would have to retaliate."" His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian TradeMinister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, thecommunity would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports. Channon made his remarks at a news conference after twodays of talks with Reagan Administration officials and membersof Congress. De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks. Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment inCongress since his visit here last year as Congress and theAdministration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. tradedeficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs. Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation toforce Japan to open its markets to foreign goods. Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyoneproblems - its surplus with the United States last year was51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs. ""The more united pressure there could be, the better,"" hesaid. Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation toavoid trade disputes. He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontationearlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain andPortugal joined the community and its liberal importsregulations were tightened to conform to EC standards. ""But if both sides drew back from the brink that time,"" hesaid, """"it does not mean that they would do so on anotheroccasion."" Channon added that ""There is increasing reesentment inEurope over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressureof unilaterally imposed deadlines."" He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft andtaxes on fats and oils - and ""the commuity and the United Statesmust therefore learn to manage their relations better."" He said another bill to let the United States retaliateagainst a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement onTariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices. He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and notby the United States, adding ""if the (trade) law is to beinterpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what isto happen to the rest of us?""

High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil'saccompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term tradeand interbank lines, the bankers said. Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreedlast March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, aspart of a 31 billion dlr financing package. Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupledwith Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legalquestions that the banks want to discuss with Gros. They said they face problems because of the freezerequirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bankunder the trade facility must be deposited instead with thecentral bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switchtheir credit lines from one borrower to another. The requirement to deposit with the central bank has alsomeant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lowerinterest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would ratheraccept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with thecentral bank.

""We're working very hard on this merger."" Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meetingto vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal. The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concernabout a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that wouldrequire Baker to sell its drilling bit operations andsubmersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened toterminate the proposed merger. The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the twocompanies first find acceptable buyers for the businessesbefore signing the decree. The directors of Baker immediately after receiving thecounter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas statecourt to force to Hughes to complete the merger. ""The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that mightbe imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervousabout what the outcome might be,"" Kistler said, in explainingwhy Hughes had made the counter proposal.

Hughes said that Baker shouldinstead complete the sale of the disputed assets before themerger is finalized and given government approval. Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptablebuyers within a specified period of time after the decree isapproved, a federal trustee would become responsible forfinding a buyer. Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could takeup to 10 years to complete the sales. He also expressed concern that the combined companies mightbe required by the government's conditions to license some ofits technology to any purchaser of the assets.

7,"China called on the United States toremove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable tradingstatus and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 areinaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuadeCongress to change laws which limit its exports.  The official International Business newspaper todaypublished China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with thevisit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.  ""It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce itsrestrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilitiesfor them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chineseexports,"" the editorial said.  ""The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice againstfavourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit Chinainto the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).  ""Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports inrecent years, control of them is still extremely strict andinfluences normal trade between the two countries,"" it added  The paper also printed an article by China's commercialcounsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who saidthat ""all kinds of difficulties and restrictions"" were preventingbilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.  He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs ontechnology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.  The paper also printed a table showing that, sincebilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit everyyear except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficitsat 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.  A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not acceptPeking's trade figures at all, mainly because they excludegoods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. WhileU.S. Figures are based on country of origin.  He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it willhave to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend severallaws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.  The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs andTrade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and ""not bedominated or controlled by international Communism.""  The official said China was well aware of the laws, someof which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but thatthere is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To changethem.  China has been the subject of about a dozen casesinvolving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,which the U.S. Side won, he said.  But, for the first time, China signed last week anagreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrainexports of at least two categories of steel goods, which maylead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.  Another diplomat said willingness to provide suchvoluntary export restraints would be an important issue inbilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.  ""China has the potential to disrupt world markets,especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervousabout China in this respect. But there is a precedent for othercentralled planned economies in GATT,"" the diplomat said.  Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members ofGATT but none has China's massive market potential for importsor its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.  In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomedChina's interest in participating in GATT.  ""The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplishedovernight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a largeeconomy of the Chinese type,"" Shultz said.  ""China can play an important role by actively joining GATTdiscussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities andenhance market access for exports worldwide. China can furtherdevelop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximumbenefit from its GATT participation,"" he said.  The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membershipare similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmenregard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especiallyfor exports, and a de facto dual currency system.  In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATTlast month, China said it was gradually reforming its economicsystem and replacing mandatory instruction with ""guidanceplanning"" and economic levers.  The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much todo. "

7,"Japanese officials sought to convince theU.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working aheadof an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove theircase. ""We are implementing the agreement in good faith and thesituation does not run counter to the pact,"" Osamu Watanabe,Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's(MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division, told foreign reporters. ""The effects of the measures we have taken and are takingare emerging in the market place,"" he said. U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanesemicrochip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell atbelow cost in markets outside Japan and the United States. The agreement, signed last September, aimed at haltingpredatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S.Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market. The comments by MITI officials followed a call by PrimeMinsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings onthe U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said. Yukio Honda, director of MITI's Industrial ElectronicsDivision, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at belowcost in third countries. MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cutproduction of key memory chips in the first quarter of thisyear has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale inthe non-regulated grey market, Honda said. ""The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, butin contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expandingmarket share because of their cheaper prices,"" Honda said. MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excesssupply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after thepact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductorexports to the United States, he added. The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelinesfor the second quarter and suggested production volumes arelikely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said. Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around anyartificial controls, regulation of supply and demand shouldbring positive results, Watanabe said. ""I am optimistic,"" headded. "

BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon tradingafter a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538pearlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39billion pre-tax. Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stockmarket plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BATshares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in theshare price. ""In the current market, people almost expect companies tobeat expectations,"" said one analyst, adding that pretax profitsof 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast. BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985pretax profit of 1.17 billion. Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from itsunderperforming industries and the decreasing share of thetobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs. BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that thetobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74pct four years ago. Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the companydeclining further as other sectors increased in importance. He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financialservices, in particular in the U.S. Sheehy also said the group had ""no sizeable acquisitions"" insight in the near future. Analysts said BAT's increasingly good performance in theU.K. Insurance area was encouraging.

""If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable thatwe keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war,then I think the answer is probably yes,"" he said. In order to reduce these tensions, decision-making in theEC must become less self-centred, and the US Administrationwill have to exercise the authority to convince Congress andpressure groups of the need for accommodation, he added.

Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one ofthe two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its shareto three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategyJonathan Solomon told reporters. That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerfulbusiness organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of thePost and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm ofprotest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreignfirms from a meaningful position in the market. Pacific Telesis Group &lt;PAC.N> of the United States alsoholds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia,&lt;International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC). Solomon said that both British Prime Minister MargaretThatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz havewritten to the Japanese government about the planned merger. A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have alsoexpressed opposition to the merger, he said. The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated againthat it sees no need for two competitors to &lt;Kokusai DenshinDenwa Co Ltd>, which holds a monopoly on international callsfrom Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreignshareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm. In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today metFumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrangethe merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked. At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibreoptic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of itsglobal network.

4,"The Bank of Spain has extended thereserve requirement for banks to their convertible peseta fundsin an attempt to curb speculation in short-term capital whichis currently fuelling money supply growth. In a statement issued late last night, the central banksaid convertible peseta accounts, funds which are not subjectto exchange controls, would also be subject to a 19 pct reserverequirement with effect from Friday. Convertible peseta funds had been previously exempt fromreserve requirements. The measure comes one week after the central bank raisedreserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentagepoint to 19 pct, also with effect on Friday. Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offernow -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- have attracted alarge influx of speculative foreign capital which isthreatening the government's monetary targets. They say this influx is largely responsible for Spain'sprincipal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquidassets in public hands (ALP), to have grown by an estimated 17pct annualised rate in February, compared with January's 8.3pct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986. Thetarget for 1987 is eight pct. The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds tobanks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the moneymarket. Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightlyTreasury Bill auction tomorrow and Friday's hike in reserverequirements, expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas fromthe system. The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interestrates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterday's 13.46 pctaverage for deposits. Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandableresponse ""given that the market is short of funds.""

5,"The European Monetary System marks itseighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world moneymarkets despite creating an island of currency rate stabilityin Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,which holds eight European Community currencies within narrowfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), hasbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alikeseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu asEurope's common currency took a step nearer to becoming realitywhen Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so farblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system'sfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt andformer French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two yearsafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have beentransferred from national governments and central banks to anautonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty ineconomic and monetary matters. ""The basic problem of the EMS isthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to asituation where certain decisions are taken in common,"" said oneeconomist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy onthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is thesystem's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged andinvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharprise of the West German mark severely strained the system. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend theEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major worldcurrency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expectedbefore the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since itwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC'shighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of CentralBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministershold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involvemore than tinkering with technical details. They are scepticalabout the chances for any fundamental change. ""Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMSagainst external factors such as dollar weakness. For that wemust take the step forward to the institutional level,"" said Leode Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will dependlargely on the success of an agreement last month among majorindustrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollarresumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, theypredict. "

2,"Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks arereporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasingprovisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non-performing loans. Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to buildreserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline alittle this year. But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problemshampering traditional lending operations mean earnings willremain vulnerable. One senior bank credit officer said ""The work is largelydone in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions,but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money."" The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - hastaken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results nowappearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broaddecline. The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks hadsunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before worldoil prices tumbled. Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate onthe Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported andrevealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 atthe expense of increased provisions. The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, &lt;United SaudiCommercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mlnriyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln. Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in partreflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearlytrebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985. Other results released so far show &lt;Saudi American Bank>(SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7mln riyals, while &lt;Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as SaudiFrench, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals. Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's &lt;CCI.N>Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez,increased provisions sharply. &lt;Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mlnriyals. Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non-performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in theSaudi economy bottoms out. Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economicactivity, but one banker said ""The top 50 pct of the Saudi banksare now at or close to international levels on provisions."" From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank &lt;NationalCommercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals inprovisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to theprivate sector, bankers calculated. Between 1982 and 1985, &lt;Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as thesecond biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, hadcovered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operateon an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine. Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has beentightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule fordeclaring loans as non-performing. Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figuresdifficult because some banks still book non-accruing interestas revenue while others follow more conservative practices inforce in major world financial centres. Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and thejoint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rankas the strongest earners. Other banks such as &lt;Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned bythe &lt;British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by arelatively low deposit base. Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mlnriyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show anotherlow figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the mostconservative in making provisions. Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see aSaudi bank go under and not only supported &lt;Saudi Cairo Bank>after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also madeavailable cheap deposits to &lt;Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB. The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, butgenerally banks are awash with liquidity since they areunwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans. And while banks in more liberal financial markets canattempt to diversify away from traditional lending,conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generatefee income from new investment banking products. One banker said ""Operating earnings in the Kingdom are notgood."" Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount ofadvances is showing a declining trend, while the days whenbanks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts toinvest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better returnon their money. In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to currentaccounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customerfunds are held on current account. "

Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that theacquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T andPhilips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV &lt;PGLO.AS> had not been decidedon two years ago as claimed by AT and T. The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemensat the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT.The result of the negotiations was still open. Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer. The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairmanJames E. Olson as saying that Siemens' attempt to stop AT and Tand Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in theU.S. Baur said he expected the French government to decide onthe winning bid by the end of April. CGCT's share of the Frenchswitchboard market amounts to around 16 pct. The French government has limited CGCT participation byforeign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francsfor the whole company. Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to theinitial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later butsaid Siemens' aim was to introduce its technology. Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm&lt;Jeumont-Schneider SA> submitted a joint offer at the start ofMarch because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies willform a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT.   Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company whileJeumont-Schneider will own 80 pct. Apart from investing 100 mlnfrancs for the modernisation of CGCT, a new research centrewith was also being planned. "

Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic PolicyCouncil prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide whatsanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement. The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to endselling semiconductors at below cost and to open its homemarket to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to foregoantidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors. But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stoppeddumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third countrydumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors. Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way toforce prices up and end the dumping. Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense ScienceBoard task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop newelectronic products and manufacturing processes and make theU.S. industory more competitive. But he added the industry could not wait for legislation topass and that action was required now to help the depressedelectronic industry.

2,"British Telecommunications Plc's &lt;BTY.L>profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced byincreasing competition and continued costs for replacing oldtelephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said. Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter resultswhich were released earlier today, Odgers said the companyfaced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systemsin Britain for three to five years. He said &lt;Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and WirelessPlc &lt;CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor. Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into someof British Telecom's most profitable areas. One company official privately estimated that BritishTelecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunicationsmarket but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct. The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, whichlead to some disruption in service, could well have encouragedclients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said. However, he forecast that the last quarter's resultsoverall should not be adversely affected by the walkout. He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls shouldbe limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities. But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength,economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growthindustry will help produce annual profit increases for theforseeable future.

Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below thepronounced prices under any circumstance."" Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free marketprices ""may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)winter season and the glut in the market."" Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord,under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixedprices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets,which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel inmid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market pricesare currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia'sadherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.

7,"Canada's decision to raise the issueof a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many seeas a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policystudy group said  ""It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period,when it was a major player in the process of building a postwarworld,"" the Washington-based Atlantic Council said. U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summeraimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries,the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipmentsof about 150 billion dlrs annually. The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadlineof October for an agreement, are the biggest issue inU.S.-Canadian relations.   The study said liberalized trade between the two countrieswould improve the competitiveness of their economies in worldmarkets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties. The council said ""in the past most Canadians have shied awayfrom the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to beoverwhelmed economically and politically by a closerassociation with a country 10 times their size in population."" But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized theirdomestic market was too small to permit the mass production andsales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by anincreasingly competitive world. The council said that in the talks, Canada is chieflyinterested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports. A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposedon Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were beingsubsidized. The council said the chief U.S. concerns included endingcurbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, andthe so-called ""cultural industries"" - publishing, broadcastingand films.

7,"The 24 nations of the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered bysluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economicgrowth, and their joint balance of payments will swing intodeficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said. The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECDeconomic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a2.8 pct growth forecast in December. It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and thesmaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardesthit by currency appreciation this year. The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growthrate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct inDecember and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan. It said it expected the OECD to post a current accountdeficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due inlarge part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely tofall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlrpayments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year. The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomesincreasingly ragged. It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline inforeign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on itstrade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after lastyear's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rateis expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with anaverage value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said. ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeperangle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireballrather than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said. ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and theFebruary meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five andCanada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift tomore expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighterU.S. Fsical policy,"" it said. It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was thewillingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Governmentassets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss. ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, addingthat if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollarwould collapse. To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rateswould have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debtcrisis, it said. On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look""increasingly sick."" Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seenslowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to4.2 pct in 1988, it said. The weakness of the West German economy is the biggestsingle factor, with import growth there expected to feature asluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast inDecember, the EIU said. On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in WestGermany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, whileJapan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, morecompetitively-priced dollar. It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials andoil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986. "

In a question-and-answer session with the public affairsgroup, Clark said that the two countries must find bettermechanisms for resolving their trade disputes. ""This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted oncorn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they werequasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in placenow are not working adequately in either of our interests,"" hesaid. Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington's ruleson government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, hesaid. ""There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order tosecure substantial contracts in the United States, have had tomove their head offices out of our country into your countrybecause you have national procurement requirements,"" he said. In turn, he added, the United States would like to changesome of the procurement requirements that exist at theprovincial government level in Canada. Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions. ""What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, inthe first instance, to propose, and then governments andcongresses will have judge,"" he said. In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United Stateshas tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports toits northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan.""Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last yearthan you bought from Canada,"" he said.

On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do nothold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes,a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futuresmarket, according to an exchange spokeswoman. ""This will change the way oil is transacted in the realworld,"" said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman. Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEXprices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at adifferential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.  The expanded program ""will serve the industry because theoil market does not close when NYMEX does,"" said Frank Capozza,secretary of Century Resources Inc.  The rule change, which has already taken effect forplatinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the openinterest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according totraders and analysts. Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, calledan exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures positionbefore entering into the transaction. Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold afutures position before entering into an EFP and one or bothparties can offset their cash transaction with a futurescontract the next day, according to exchange officials. When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December,NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, ""Expansion of the EFPprovision will add to globalization of the energy markets byproviding for, in effect, 24-hour trading.""

6,"The U.S. Departments of Agricultureand Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund theincreasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vesselsunder a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference. Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a HouseAgriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the twodepartments are negotiating a ""memorandum of understanding"" oncargo preference. Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of foodaid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to graduallyincrease over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased costof using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the TransportationDepartment instead of USDA. However, USDA officials saidTransportation has so far contributed no money. The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expectedto resolve the matter, USDA officials said. Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign AgriculturalService said yesterday the requirement that more food aidshipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult tomeet. ""As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up,its going to be harder and harder to meet,"" Kay said. Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and GlennEnglish (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm exportprograms more costly and the program should be eliminated. In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preferencehave been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests whoview cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet. "

5,"The monetary authorities of the majorindustrialised countries lost their credibility this week asthe dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers andwidespread central bank intervention, dealers said. The dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month'sParis currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, WestGermany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal ofthe success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plazameeting to weaken the dollar, they said. The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar wasovervalued but this time the market and the authorities are ondifferent sides, dealers said. Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations hasencouraged the market to challenge the authorities despiteconcerted intervention by the central banks of the UnitedStates, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said. Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa foraction to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend bycomments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there wasno target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway. Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Parisaccord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said. The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman PaulVolcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to ahalt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, theynoted. The situation has again raised the question of whetherintervention can succeed against the trend in today's hugecurrency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response tointervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars. ""This means that the current dollar selling is not of asheer speculative nature but backed by real demand,"" said KoichiMiyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank. Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite theintervention and it is only a matter of time before someoperators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed inTokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its recordlow was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday. Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support torise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Sevenindustrial nations meets to discuss currencies again. The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plusItaly) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currenciesapart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said. Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could beused and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Parisaccord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing toprevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S.Trade deficit, especially with Japan. Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for alower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said. The market now thinks the central bank action is to slowthe dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, saidTadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected largeforward dollar sales from April to June for export billsfalling due for Japanese exporters from April to September. The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yendepreciation, dealers said. Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looksineffective in light of this real demand, they said. The market is also anticipating active institutional dollarsales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the newbusiness year starting April 1, dealers said. ""The market seems to have established a new dollar tradingrange between 147 and 149 yen,"" one dealer said. The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Parisaccord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the lowend for the dollar against the yen, he said. Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to145. "

5,"The Bank of Japan is satisfied with theyen around its current range, a senior central bank officialtold reporters. He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Parislast month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around currentranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollarrise. Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currencystability, but it can be useful when coordinated with otherpolicies and with other central banks, he said. The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stabilitywill continue for some time, the senior bank official said, butdeclined to be more specific. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Fridaythe current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarilysatisfactory for the Japanese economy. Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, theofficial cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, acompletely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S.Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by governmentofficials seeking to talk the dollar up or down. The senior bank official said he expects Japan's grossnational product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more inthe fiscal year beginning in April. That would be littlechanged from the performance expected this year. Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, butthe external sector will have a negative impact on GNP ofnearly one percentage point, he said. He said there was virtually no room for further monetarypolicy action to boost the economy. The economy's performancein the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added. The central bank's monetary policy has already done itspart in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said.The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over thelast year and a half. Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk ofinflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said.""We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it maystill be wet,"" he added.

4,"Surprisingly strong U.S. housingstatistics for February cannot be taken as an indication thatthe economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficientcause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth,economists said. Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusuallymild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said thatseasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to theeconomy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. Andafter a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom. U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to aseasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April1986. The rate at which permits were issued for future buildingclimbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January. ""February's weather is usually more adverse for homebuilding. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult todetermine what this means for the economy down the road,"" saidAllan Leslie of Discount Corp. The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate forweather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperaturesinflate the statistics. Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur tobuilding last month. But several believe that rates will nowconsolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer. ""Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying'Let's do it now',"" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League ofSavings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply muchof the financing for home building. But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downwardpotential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the U.S. economy. He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in earlysummer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. LastNovember, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct. As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated inthe single-family sector. The multi-family area -- whichtypically represents rental units -- remained weak due to highvacancy rates and increased capital costs of such unitsfollowing tax law changes effective January 1. Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317mln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate. ""Strength in the single-family sector indicates that lowmortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably notlooking at a great deal of growth potential,"" said WardMcCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. McCarthy noted that the housing report, together withlarger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrialoutput and retail sales in February, may cause some observersto start waving ""four pct GNP banners"" for the first quarter.Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter. But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP tocome in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is notconvinced that growth will pick up in future. ""The big story is the inventory re-building that's going onnow, not all of which is intentional,"" he said. For example,U.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in Februarycompared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln. Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the firstquarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weakergrowth in the second, he said. ""If most of the first quarter growth is inventory buildingand we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, thenthere is the potential for softness in the second quarter,""agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluatingfirst quarter GNP prospects. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week thatcurrent data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed. ""At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in thefirst quarter, we could foresee production slowing in thesecond,"" cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and MaffeiInc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.

Some outstanding debt will be retired. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, hastold the company it is confident it can arrange the entirefinancing needed for the recapitalization.

Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommendsthat shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer. The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday.

Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalizationcommon and common-equivalent shares outstanding. Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook,Gluck said ""we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrsin 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lowerinterest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debtincurred in connection with the recapitalization."" He said the company does not usually release projections,but has done so now beause of the significance of therecapitalization. Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted forstockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June. The plan will require the approval of stockholders and thatof the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities. As part of the plan, the company will change its state ofincorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger ofCaesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will providefor, among other things, a ""fair price"" provision requiring thatcertain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders beapproved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding sharesheld by such interested stockholders. Caesars World said in a statement that ""the cashdistribution will result in a substantial deficit instockholders' equity."" It did not give an estimate of the sizeof this deficit. But the company said its financial advisors have said theybelieve that after the recapitalization, Caesars World shouldhave the financial flexibility and resources necessary tofinance its current and projected operating and capitalrequirements.
